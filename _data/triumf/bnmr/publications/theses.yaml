    This thesis is a presentation of experiments examining the induced hyperfine
    magnetism in the nonmagnetic layers of two thin film magnetic multilayers,
    Au(40 Å)/Ag(200 Å)/Fe(140 Å) and Au(40 Å)/Ag(800 Å)/Fe(20 Å) grown on GaAs
    (001) single crystal substrates. The main technique used in this study was
    beta-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (βNMR) conducted at TRIUMF
    laboratories in Vancouver, British Columbia. βNMR makes NMR measurements on
    radioactive <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> (<i>τ</i> = 1.21 sec) nuclei that are
    implanted directly into the sample. Resonant βNMR experiments showed strong
    induced magnetism in the non-magnetic Ag layer due the magnetic Fe.
    Comparison of a theoretical model to experimental results on the
    Au(40 Å)/Ag(200 Å)/Fe(140 Å) sample suggest that the induced hyperfine
    magnetism decays with distance into the Ag layer from the
    magnetic/nonmagnetic interface like x<sup>-1.84</sup> from a maximum of
    ~0.3 T at the magnetic/nonmagnetic interface.

    Measurement of the London penetration depth in the Meissner state of
    NbSe<sub>2</sub> using low energy polarized <sup>8</sup>Li
  author:
    - M. M. Hossain
  abstract: >-
    In this thesis, the Meissner state of NbSe<sub>2</sub> was investigated
    using low energy beam of spin polarized <sup>8</sup>Li. The <sup>8</sup>Li
    nuclear spin relaxation rate 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> was measured as a
    function of temperature and magnetic field. The spin relaxation rate is
    sensitive to low frequency nuclear spin dynamics of the host Nb spins and is
    strongly field dependent. This is used to determine the reduction in the
    magnetic field upon cooling into the Meissner state. Using a calculated
    implantation profile and a model field distribution, one can extract a
    measure of the absolute value of the London penetration depth <i>λ</i> in
    Meissner state. In addition, a model field distribution, assuming a
    suppression of order parameter near surface, was developed. In this case, we
    can extract another length scale which is related to the "coherence" length
    <i>ξ</i>. The value of <i>λ</i> depends on the model field distribution but
    is significantly longer than that obtained previously in the vortex state
    using μSR. From the measured internal magnetic field distribution, London
    penetration <i>λ<sub>L</sub></i> is extracted as a function of temperature.
    There is also evidence of the coherence peak in 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> of
    host nuclear spins. <i>λ<sub>L</sub></i>(<i>T</i>) follows the two-fluid
    model of superconductivity. Depending on the model for internal field
    distribution, <i>λ<sub>L</sub></i>(0) varies in the range (1795-2434) Å.

    Near surface vortex lattice in NbSe<sub>2</sub> studied with low energy
    beta-NMR
  author:
    - D. Wang
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    In this thesis, the magnetic field distribution in the vortex state of
    NbSe<sub>2</sub> is investigated with the technique of depth resolved
    β-detected NMR using a beam of highly polarized <sup>8</sup>Li produced at
    the TRIUMF ISAC facility. The β-NMR lineshape is a direct measure of the
    local magnetic field distribution weighted according to the implantation
    profile of the <sup>8</sup>Li beam. By varying the implantation energy
    between 1 ~ 30 keV, one can control the average implantation depth
    corresponds in a range between 5 ~ 136 nm. Above <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> = 7.0
    K a relatively narrow resonance is observed whose width is attributed to
    magnetic dipolar broadening from the <sup>93</sup>Nb nuclear moments. Below
    <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> a much broader asymmetric lineshape is observed, which
    is characteristic of a triangular magnetic vortex lattice. Modeling the
    magnetic field distribution allows one to determine both the effective in
    plane penetration depth <i>λ</i><sub>||</sub> and the effective in plane
    coherence length <i>ξ</i><sub>||</sub> or vortex core radius.
    </p>
    <p>
    In a magnetic field of 302 mT, we obtain <i>λ</i><sub>||</sub> = 279(30) nm
    and <i>ξ</i><sub>||</sub> = 12(1) nm. In a smaller magnetic field of 10.84
    mT, the effective coherence length increases dramatically to a value of
    77(10) nm. This is more than an order of magnitude larger than the expected
    from the coherence length in NbSe<sub>2</sub>. The origin of the giant
    vortices is discussed. We propose an explanation involving the multiband
    nature of NbSe<sub>2</sub>.

    Magnetic properties near the surface of cuprate superconductors studied
    using beta-detected NMR
  author:
    - H. Saadaoui
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    Beta-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (β-NMR) uses highly spin polarized
    β-emitting nuclei as a probe. Besides its use in nuclear physics, it has
    also become a powerful and sensitive tool in condensed matter physics and
    materials science. At TRIUMF, β-NMR of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has been
    developed to study materials in a depth-resolved manner, where the
    implantation depth of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> is controlled via
    electrostatic deceleration. In this thesis, β-NMR of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has been used to study high-<i>T<sub>c</sub></i>
    cuprate superconductors (HTSC). The objective of this work is to search for
    spontaneous magnetic fields generated by a possible time-reversal symmetry
    breaking (TRSB) superconducting state near the surface of hole-doped
    YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-δ</sub> (YBCO), and study the nature of
    the vortex lattice (VL) in YBCO and electron-doped
    Pr<sub>2-x</sub>Ce<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4-δ</sub> (PCCO). For several
    advantages, our measurements were carried out by implanting
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in thin silver films evaporated on the
    superconductors.
    </p>
    <p>
    In our TRSB studies, the magnetic field distribution <i>p</i>(<i>B</i>) is
    measured 8 nm away from the Ag/YBCO interface in magnetic fields
    <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> = 5 to 100 G, applied parallel to the interface.
    <i>p</i>(<i>B</i>) showed significant broadening below the
    <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> of <i>ab</i>- and <i>c</i>-axis oriented YBCO films.
    The broadening signals the existence of weak disordered magnetic fields near
    the surface of YBCO. From the broadening's temperature and field dependence
    we draw an upper limit of 0.2 G on the magnitude of spontaneous magnetic
    fields associated with TRSB.
    </p>
    <p>
    To study the VL, <i>p</i>(<i>B</i>) is measured at average implantation
    depths ranging from 20 to 90 nm away from the Ag/YBCO or Ag/PCCO interface
    in <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> = 0.1 to 33 kG, applied perpendicular to the surface.
    <i>p</i>(<i>B</i>) showed a dramatic broadening below <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>
    as expected from the emerging field lines of the VL in the superconductor.
    In YBCO, <i>p</i>(<i>B</i>) is symmetric and the dependence on
    <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> is much weaker than expected from an ideal VL,
    indicating that the vortex density varies across the face of the sample on a
    long length scale, likely due to vortex pinning at twin boundaries. In PCCO,
    a 2D VL is established due to the high anisotropy of the superconductor
    leading to a nearly symmetric <i>p</i>(<i>B</i>).

    Using low-energy <sup>8</sup>Li beta-detected NMR to probe the magnetism of
    transition metals
  author:
    - T. J. Parolin
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    Low-energy, beta-radiation-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) is
    applied to probe the magnetism of Au and Pd. The measurements were carried
    out at the TRIUMF β-NMR facility using optically spin-polarized
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> as the probe.
    </p>
    <p>
    The behaviour of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in Au was investigated using
    samples in the form of a foil and a 100 nm film evaporated onto a MgO (100)
    substrate. The results are in overall agreement with those obtained
    previously in Ag, Cu, and Al. Narrow, temperature-independent resonances are
    observed and assigned to ions stopping in the octahedral interstitial and
    substitutional lattice sites; the latter appearing only for temperatures
    above 150 K which is attributed to a thermally-activated site change. The
    spin-lattice relaxation rate of substitutional site ions is less than half
    as fast at ambient temperature as that in the other simple metals. The rate
    is independent of external field for fields greater than 15 mT. A Korringa
    analysis for the substitutional ions indicates no significant electron
    enhancement over that of a free electron gas. For all four metals, the
    enhancements obtained are smaller than those for the host nuclei. No depth
    dependence was found for the resonances in Au.
    </p>
    <p>
    The highly exchange-enhanced metal Pd was studied using samples in the form
    of a foil and a 100 nm film evaporated onto a SrTiO<sub>3</sub> (100)
    substrate. Strongly temperature-dependent, negative shifts are observed
    that scale with the temperature dependence of the host susceptibility
    between room temperature and 110 K. The resonances appear as two partially
    resolved lines that exhibit similar behaviour with temperature. The
    linewidths are broad and double upon cooling. The data are indicative of
    ions stopping in a site of cubic symmetry. The spin-lattice relaxation rate
    increases linearly with increasing temperature and eventually saturates at
    higher temperatures, consistent with the prediction from spin fluctuation
    theory. In contrast to the simple metals, large Korringa enhancements are
    obtained in this host. Ferromagnetic dynamical scaling is observed to hold
    above 110 K. Features below this temperature indicate that the Li ions
    locally induce a further enhancement of the static susceptibility. The
    temperature dependence of the modified susceptibility is in keeping with
    the prediction for a weak itinerant ferromagnet just above the Curie
    temperature; however, there is no evidence of static order.

- title: β-Detected NMR of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in spintronic materials

  abstract: >-
    <p>
    β-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (βNMR) employs radioactive
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>, which is optically spin-polarized, as a local
    probe to study magnetism in materials via β decay. In this thesis, βNMR is
    applied to spintronic materials, including GaAs,
    Ga<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>As and Fe/GaAs heterostructures in a
    depth-controlled manner at TRIUMF.
    </p>
    <p>
    High resolution β-NMR measurements were carried out on GaAs crystals
    (semi-insulating (SI-GaAs) and heavily doped <i>n</i>-type (<i>n</i>-GaAs))
    as a control experiment for β-NMR on Fe/GaAs heterostructures. A small
    resonance shift was observed and found to be dependent on depth, temperature
    and doping. The depth dependence is only observed in SI-GaAs and not in
    <i>n</i>-GaAs. The resonance shift below 150 K in both GaAs is ~100 ppm, on
    the same order of some Knight shifts of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in noble
    metals.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ga<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>As is the first βNMR study on a ferromagnetic
    material through the ferromagnetic transition. Both spin lattice relaxation
    (SLR) and resonance of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> were measured. Two
    resonances were clearly resolved from the nonmagnetic GaAs substrate and the
    magnetic Ga<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>As film. The latter one negatively
    shifts and is linearly proportional to the applied field. The hyperfine
    coupling constant AHF of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in
    Ga<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>As is found to be negative. The SLR rate λ
    does not follow Korringa’s Law and its amplitude shows a weak temperature
    dependence through <i>T<sub>C</sub></i>. The behaviours of AHF and λ suggest
    that the delocalized holes originate from a Mn derived impurity band. No
    evidence of magnetic phase separation is found.
    </p>
    <p>
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> provides a new depth-dependent local probe to
    detect injected spin polarization. We measured the
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> resonance in Fe/GaAs heterostructures with
    semi-insulating and heavily doped <i>n</i>-type substrates, with and without
    injected current. With zero current, no spin polarization at thermal
    equilibrium is found. A new current injection system was designed and setup
    to conduct current injection from the thin Fe layer into the <i>n</i>-GaAs
    substrate. We found effects of local Joule heating and a very small stray
    field caused by the injected current but no convincing evidence of injected
    spin polarization.

    Synthesis and electronic ordering phenomena of calcium ruthenate thin films
  author:
    - C. J. Dietl
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    The prospect to harness the wide range of electronic phenomena foundin
    transition metal oxides by synthesizing thin film structures and their
    implementation into next-generation technologies has sparked a research
    activity of ever increasing pace. Most prominent are thin film techniques
    such as heterostructuring and strain engineering, whichhave been shown to
    open up new paths to study the rich physics in these compounds.
    </p>
    <p>
    This work constitutes a study of the thin film synthesis of the layered
    orthorhombic transition metal oxide compound Ca<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>
    (CRO) and of the impact of biaxial epitaxial strain on the magnetic and
    orbital ordering phenomena previously found by spectroscopic methods. The
    electronic structure of CRO and other transition metal oxides with
    4<i>d</i>-valence electrons is of significant topical interest, because the
    energy scales of spin-orbit-coupling, exchange energy and crystal field are
    comparable. As a result, the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator CRO plays host
    to an array of novel ground states and is highly susceptible to external
    perturbations as has been shown by numerous studies on single crystals
    involving e.g pressure, chemical substitutionand electrical current.
    </p>
    <p>
    Embarking on the strategy to exploit this sensitivity of CRO, we employ
    strain engineering via thin film growth to tune its properties. The details
    of the synthesis route using pulsed laser deposition arepresented. Growth
    was accomplished with two distinct sets of high-quality samples -
    <i>a</i>-axis oriented films on LaSrAlO<sub>4</sub> and
    NdCaAlO<sub>4</sub> substrates with (110) cut and <i>c</i>-axis oriented
    films on LaAlO<sub>3</sub>, LaSrAlO<sub>4</sub> and YAlO<sub>3</sub>
    substrates with (001) cut. Structural characterization shows that the
    epitaxy exerts strains of 1%–3% on the lattice constants of CRO compared to
    the bulk system. These large distortions manifest themselves in the
    electrical transport properties, which shows that the electronic state can
    be profoundly tuned froman insulator to a metal.
    </p>
    <p>
    Comprehensive resonant elastic X-ray scattering and magnetometry studies
    confirm the presence of antiferromagnetism in CRO on LaAlO<sub>3</sub>,
    NdCaAlO<sub>4</sub> and LaSrAlO<sub>4</sub> (110) at <i>T<sub>N</sub></i> =
    150 K, similar to the antiferromagnetic state found in bulk. Detailed
    polarization analysis of resonant peaks reveals a <i>b</i>-axis oriented
    magnetic moment for CRO on LaSrAlO<sub>4</sub> (110), as found in bulk. On
    the other side, CRO on NdCaAlO<sub>4</sub> shows an unusual signal that is
    compatible with a magnetic moment 45<sup>◦</sup> away from the
    <i>c</i>-axis, approximately along the
    (<span style="text-decoration: overline">1</span>02) direction of the
    orthorhombic unit cell of CRO, which has not been reported for the bulk
    system. Furthermore, magnetoresistance and magnetometry measurements show a
    weak ferromagnetic signal along the <i>c</i>-axis within the
    antiferromagnetic phases. We show that, while a moment direction along the
    <i>b</i>-axis is compatible with a representation analysis of the bulk Pbca
    space group, the presence of a weak ferromagnetic component along the
    <i>c</i>-axis and the peculiar magnetic moment direction along the
    (<span style="text-decoration: overline">1</span>02) for CRO on
    NdCaAlO<sub>4</sub> cannot be described by a single irreducible
    representation of the space group Pbca. Thus, we suggest either an exotic
    scenario with more than one critical irreducible representation or that the
    thin films exhibit anunusual symmetry reduction from the bulk space group
    Pbca. The finding of a strain-induced moment direction switching points to a
    non-trivial effect of epitaxial strain on the magnetic interactions inCRO.
    </p>
    <p>
    Magnetometry, magnetoresistance and polarized neutron reflectometry
    experiments were conducted to investigate a low-temperature ferromagnetic
    phase in the <i>c</i>-axis oriented samples. Similar to pressurized bulk, we
    find ferromagnetic moment amplitudes of the order 0.1 μ<sub>B</sub>/Ru and
    an enhancement under compressive strain. Polarized neutron reflectometry was
    used to exclude impurity phases or surface effects as the underlying
    mechanism. Analogous to the pressurized bulk system, we found a giant
    positive magnetoresistance in CRO on LaAlO<sub>3</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Moreover, a combined nuclear magnetic resonance and resonant elastic X-ray
    scattering study was dedicated to study the impact ofepitaxial strain on
    quadrupolar order previously found in bulk CRO. Due to the small mass of the
    thin films, the nuclear magnetic resonance experiments were conducted using
    the βNMR-technique, which detects the spin lattice relaxation through the
    asymmetry of the β-decay of highly-polarized <sup>8</sup>Li-isotopes. The
    temperature dependenceof the relaxation rate of the <i>c</i>-axis oriented
    films showed an increase towards higher temperatures, starting at ~200 K.
    More detailed measurements on metallic CRO on LaSrAlO<sub>4</sub> (001)
    revealed an anomaly at 300 K, which is reminiscent of a phase transition.
    Since resonant X-ray scattering on bulk CRO showed orbital ordering
    phenomena in the same temperature range, we similarly searched for
    quadrupolar ordering using synchrotron radiation tuned to the Ru-L
    absorption edges. However, the resonant peaks detected in our experiments
    could be fully described by Templeton scattering, a phenomenon arising from
    purely structural effects. For reference purposes, we performed a similar
    analysis for the single crystal showing that the results previously
    interpreted as antiferro-orbital order bear many signatures of Templeton
    scattering as well. Thus, this work motivates a reevaluation of the original
    scattering study. An alternative scenario for the βNMR anomaly based on
    diffusion of the <sup>8</sup>Li-ions is discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
    The synthesis of CRO on a variety of substrates enables furtherstudies of
    the influence of large structural distortions on the electronic states in
    CRO, which are currently inaccessible by pressuretechniques for single
    crystals. This opens up new opportunities to test theories regarding the
    electronic states in CRO, which are intensively debated due to multiple
    competing energy scales. Specifically, arecently proposed strong spin-orbit
    coupling picture for CRO predictsa high sensitivity towards the crystal
    field splitting in this material, which is directly tuned via the epitaxial
    strain. The large tunabilityof the electronic properties CRO by epitaxial
    strain might be usefulfor future thin film devices

    Diffusion and surface trapping of <sup>8</sup>Li in rutile TiO<sub>2</sub>
    and the comparison on <sup>8</sup>Li and <sup>9</sup>Li spin relaxation
    using β-NMR
  author:
    - C. A. Chatzichristos
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    It is well established that the properties of many materials change as their
    thickness is shrunk to the nanoscale, often yielding novel features at the
    near-surface region that are absent in the bulk. Even though there are
    several techniques that can study either the bulk or the surface of these
    materials, there are very few that can scan the near-surface region of
    crystals and thin films versus depth. Beta-detected NMR (β-NMR) is capable
    of this and therefore has been established as a powerful tool for material
    science. This thesis aims to further develop the capabilities of β-NMR.
    </p>
    <p>
    The first part of this thesis demonstrates that by comparing the
    spin-lattice relaxation rates (SLR) of two radioactive Li isotopes
    (<sup>8,9</sup>Li) it is possible to distinguish whether the source of SLR
    in a given situation is driven by magnetic or electric interactions. This is
    an important development for β-NMR, since there are instances where it is
    problematic to distinguish whether the measured relaxation is due to
    magnetic or electric fluctuations. Using this method, it was found that the
    SLR in Pt is (almost) purely magnetic in origin, whereas the spin relaxation
    in SrTiO<sub>3</sub> is driven (almost) entirely by electric quadrupolar
    interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
    The second part of this thesis traces the development of α-radiotracer, that
    uses the progeny α-particles from the decay of <sup>8</sup>Li, in order to
    directly measure the nanoscale diffusivity of Li<sup>+</sup> in Li-ion
    battery materials. To develop this technique, Monte Carlo simulations of the
    experimental configuration were carried out, a new apparatus and a new
    α-detector were designed and used for experiments on rutile TiO<sub>2</sub>.
    In rutile, the measurements revealed that Li<sup>+</sup> gets trapped at the
    (001) surface, a result that helps explain the suppressed intercalation of
    Li<sup>+</sup> in bulk rutile. Moreover, the diffusion rate of
    Li<sup>+</sup> in rutile was found to follow a bi-Arrhenius relationship,
    with a high-<i>T</i> activation energy in agreement with other reported
    measurements and a low-<i>T</i> component of similar magnitude with the
    theoretically calculated diffusion barrier as well as the activation energy
    of the Li-polaron complex found with β-NMR below 100 K.

    Microscopic dynamics of isolated lithium in crystalline solids revealed by
    nuclear magnetic relaxation and resonance of <sup>8</sup>Li
  author:
    - R. M. L. McFadden
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    This thesis reports measurements on the dynamics of isolated lithium in
    single crystal materials using ion-implanted <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected
    nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation and resonance
    measurements, we identify the kinetic parameters describing the ion’s
    site-to-site hop rate – the elementary process in long-range solid-state
    diffusion – and compare the results with theoretical work in the literature,
    as well as experiments at higher concentration. In addition to these "ionic"
    details, the nuclear magnetic resonance probe provides information on the
    electronic properties of the host, whose most intriguing features are also
    discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the one-dimensional ion conductor rutile
    TiO<sub>2</sub>, we find two sets of thermally activated dynamics: one below
    100 K and another at higher temperatures. We suggest the low temperature
    process is unrelated to lithium motion, but rather a consequence of electron
    polarons in the vicinity of the implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>. Above
    100 K, Li⁺ undergoes diffusion as an isolated uncomplexed cation,
    characterized by an activation energy and prefactor that are in agreement
    with macroscopic diffusion measurements, but not with theory.
    </p>
    <p>
    In Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>Se, a topological insulator with layered
    tetradymite structure, implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> undergoes ionic
    diffusion above 150 K, likely in the van der Waals gap between adjacent Te
    planes. A comparison with structurally related materials reveals the
    mobility of isolated Li<sup>+</sup> is exceptional. At lower temperature, we
    find linear Korringa-like relaxation, but with a field dependent slope and
    intercept, accompanied by an anomalous field dependence to the resonance
    shift. We suggest that these may be related to a strong contribution from
    orbital currents or the magnetic freezeout of charge carriers in this
    heavily compensated semiconductor.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the doped tetradymite topological insulators
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>:Ca and Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>:Mn, the
    onset of lithium dynamics is suppressed to above 200 K. At low temperatures,
    the nuclear magnetic resonance properties are those of a heavily doped
    semiconductor in the metallic limit, with Korringa relaxation and a small,
    negative, temperature-dependent Knight shift. From this, we make a detailed
