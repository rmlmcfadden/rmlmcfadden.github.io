    A nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectrum of <sup>8</sup>Li has been
    observed in a single crystal of SrTiO<sub>3</sub> using a beam of low-energy
    highly polarized radioactive <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>. The resonances were
    detected by monitoring the β-decay anisotropy as a function of a small audio
    frequency magnetic field. These results demonstrate that low energy nuclear
    spin polarized <sup>8</sup>Li can be used as a sensitive probe of the local
    magnetic and electronic environment in nanostructures and ultrathin films in
    zero static applied magnetic field.

    Depth-controlled β-NMR can be used to probe the magnetic properties of thin
    films and interfaces on a nanometer length scale. A 30 keV beam of highly
    spin-polarized <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> ions was slowed down and implanted
    into a 50 nm film of Ag deposited on a SrTiO<sub>3</sub> substrate. A novel
    high field β-NMR spectrometer was used to observe two well resolved
    resonances which are attributed to Li occupying substitutional and
    octahedral interstitial sites in the Ag lattice. The temperature dependence
    of the Knight shifts and spin relaxation rates are consistent with the
    Korringa law for a simple metal, implying that the NMR of implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li reflects the spin suspectibility of bulk metallic silver.

    We demonstrate that zero-field β-detected nuclear quadrupole resonance and
    spin relaxation of low energy <sup>8</sup>Li can be used as a sensitive
    local probe of structural phase transitions near a surface. We find that the
    transition near the surface of a SrTiO<sub>3</sub> single crystal occurs at
    <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> ~ 150 K, i.e., ~45 K higher than
    <i>T<sub>c</sub></i><sup>bulk</sup>, and that the tetragonal domains formed
    below <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> are randomly oriented.

    The temperature dependence of the frequency shift and spin-lattice
    relaxation rate of isolated, nonmagnetic <sup>8</sup>Li impurities implanted
    in a nearly ferromagnetic host (Pd) are measured by means of β-detected
    nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR). The shift is negative, very large, and
    increases monotonically with decreasing T in proportion to the bulk
    susceptibility of Pd for <i>T</i> > <i>T</i><sup>*</sup> ≈ 100 K. Below
    <i>T</i><sup>*</sup>, an additional shift occurs which we attribute to the
    response of Pd to the defect. The relaxation rate is much slower than
    expected for the large shift and is linear with <i>T</i> below
    <i>T</i><sup>*</sup>, showing no sign of additional relaxation mechanisms
    associated with the defect.

    Depth-controlled β-NMR was used to study highly spin-polarized
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in a Cu film of thickness 100 nm deposited onto a
    MgO substrate. The positive Knight shifts and spin relaxation data show that
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> occupies two sites at low temperatures, assigned
    to be the substitutional (<i>S</i>) and octahedral (<i>O</i>) interstitial
    sites. Between 50 and 150 K, there is a site change from <i>O</i> to
    <i>S</i>. The temperature dependence of the Knight shifts and spin-lattice
    relaxation rates at high temperatures, i.e., when all the Li are in the

    A low energy radioactive beam of polarized <sup>8</sup>Li has been used to
    observe the vortex lattice near the surface of superconducting
    NbSe<sub>2</sub>. The inhomogeneous magnetic-field distribution associated
    with the vortex lattice was measured using depth-resolved β-detected NMR.
    Below <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>, one observes the characteristic line shape for a
    triangular vortex lattice which depends on the magnetic penetration depth
    and vortex core radius. The size of the vortex core varies strongly with the
    magnetic field. In particular, in a low field of 10.8 mT, the core radius is
    much larger than the coherence length. The possible origin of these giant
    vortices is discussed.

    The magnetic properties of a monolayer of Mn<sub>12</sub> single molecule
    magnets grafted onto a silicon (Si) substrate have been investigated using
    depth-controlled β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance. A low-energy beam of
    spin-polarized radioactive <sup>8</sup>Li was used to probe the local static
    magnetic field distribution near the Mn<sub>12</sub> monolayer in the Si
    substrate. The resonance line width varies strongly as a function of
    implantation depth as a result of the magnetic dipolar fields generated by
    the Mn<sub>12</sub> electronic magnetic moments. The temperature dependence
    of the line width indicates that the magnetic properties of the
    Mn<sub>12</sub> moments in this low-dimensional configuration differ from
    bulk Mn<sub>12</sub>.

    Low-energy β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance was used to investigate the
    spatial dependence of the hyperfine magnetic fields induced by Fe in the
    nonmagnetic Ag of an Au(40 Å)/Ag(200 Å)/Fe(140 Å) (001) magnetic multilayer
    grown on GaAs. The resonance line shape in the Ag layer shows dramatic
    broadening compared to that of intrinsic Ag. This broadening is attributed
    to large magnetic fields induced in this layer by the magnetic Fe layer. We
    find that the induced hyperfine field in the Ag follows a power law decay
    away from the Ag/Fe interface with power −1.93(8), and a field extrapolated
    to 0.23(5) T at the interface.

    We report the behavior of low energy <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted
    into gold as revealed by beta-detected NMR. At an external magnetic field of
    3 T, two narrow resonances are observed, which are attributed to Li in the
    octahedral interstitial and the substitutional lattice sites. The Knight
    shifts for these two resonances are found to be temperature independent with
    values of +141(4) and +73(5) ppm, respectively. The spin-lattice relaxation
    rate in high magnetic fields at 290 K is slow, consistent with the Korringa
    relation; however, the rate increases dramatically for magnetic fields below
    about 2 mT. We attribute this to interaction of the <sup>8</sup>Li spin with
    the host lattice nuclear spins.

    Low energy ion implantation of hyperpolarized radioactive magnetic resonance
    probes allows the NMR study of thin film heterostructures by enabling
    depth-resolved measurements on a nanometer lengthscale. By stopping the
    probe ions in a layer adjacent to a layer of interest, it is possible to
    study magnetic fields proximally. Here we show that, in the simplest case of
    a uniformly magnetized layer, this yields an unperturbed in situ frequency
    reference. We also discuss demagnetization contributions to measured shifts
    for this case. With a simple illustrative calculation, we show how a
    nonuniformly magnetized layer causes a strongly depth-dependent line
    broadening in an adjacent layer. We then give some experimental examples of
    resonance line broadening in heterostructures.

    A low energy beam of spin polarized 8Li has been used to investigate nuclear
    spin relaxation in the multiband superconductor NbSe<sub>2</sub>. In low
    magnetic fields there is significant cross relaxation between the
    <sup>8</sup>Li and the host <sup>93</sup>Nb spins, which is driven by low
    frequency fluctuations in the nuclear magnetic dipolar interaction. The rate
    of cross relaxation is strongly field dependent and thus the
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> spin relaxation rate of the <sup>8</sup>Li is a
    sensitive monitor of the static local magnetic field <i>B</i> just below the
    surface. This in turn is used to determine the absolute value of the
    magnetic penetration depth λ in the Meissner state. The temperature
    variations in 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and λ are consistent with a wide
    distribution of superconducting gaps expected for a multiband
    superconductor.

    We report results of beta-detected NMR of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>
    implanted in Nb at high magnetic field. We identify two distinct sites for
    <sup>8</sup>Li in the body-centered lattice. At low temperature, the site is
    characterized by a well-defined quadrupolar splitting. At about 50 K this
    site becomes unstable. Close to room temperature, Li occupies the cubic
    substitutional site. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements are consistent
    with a site-dependent coupling to the Nb conduction electrons and suggest
    that the site change proceeds in two steps. We report Knight shifts for the
    two well-defined sites and perform a Korringa analysis.

    β-detected NMR (β-NMR) has been used to study vortex lattice disorder near
    the surface of the high-<i>T<sub>C</sub></i> superconductor
    YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-δ</sub> (YBCO). The magnetic-field
    distribution from the vortex lattice was detected by implanting a low-energy
    beam of highly polarized <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> into a thin overlayer of
    silver on optimally doped, twinned, and detwinned YBCO samples. The
    resonance in Ag broadens significantly below the transition temperature
    <i>T<sub>C</sub></i> as expected from the emerging field lines of the vortex
    lattice in YBCO. However, the lineshape is more symmetric and the dependence
    on the applied magnetic field is much weaker than expected from an ideal
    vortex lattice, indicating that the vortex density varies across the face of
    the sample, likely due to pinning at twin boundaries. At low temperatures
    the broadening from such disorder does not scale with the superfluid
    density.

    Weak spontaneous magnetic fields are observed near the surface of
    YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-δ</sub> films using β-detected nuclear
    magnetic resonance. Below <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>, the magnetic field
    distribution in a silver film evaporated onto the superconductor shows
    additional line broadening, indicating the appearance of small disordered
    magnetic fields. The line broadening increases linearly with a weak external
    magnetic field applied parallel to the surface, and is depth independent up
    to 45 nm from the Ag/YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-δ</sub> interface.
    The magnitude of the line broadening extrapolated to zero applied field is
    less than 0.2 G, and is close to nuclear dipolar broadening in the Ag. This
    indicates that any fields due to broken time-reversal symmetry are less than
    0.2 G.

    A β-detected nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectrometer becomes a
    powerful tool to study changes in nuclear ground-state properties along
    isotopic chains when coupled to a laser excitation beamline to polarize the
    nuclei of interest. Recently, the β-NQR technique in a zero magnetic field
    has been applied for the first time to measure the ratio of static nuclear
    quadrupole moments of <sup>8,9</sup>Li, <i>Q</i><sub>9</sub>/<i>Q</i><sub>8</sub>
    = 0.96675(9) denoted by <i>Q</i><sub>8</sub> for <sup>8</sup>Li and
    <i>Q</i><sub>9</sub> for <sup>9</sup>Li, respectively. This shows agreement
    with present literature values but with significantly improved precision.
    Based on the literature, the quadrupole moment for <sup>8</sup>Li has been
    re-evaluated to be |<i>Q</i><sub>8</sub>| = 32.6(5) mb. From this, the
    quadrupole moment for <sup>9</sup>Li is calculated as |<i>Q</i><sub>9</sub>|
    = 31.5(5) mb with the error being dominated by the error of
    <i>Q</i><sub>8</sub>.

    We present an investigation of the near-surface tetragonal phase transition
    in SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, using the complementary techniques of beta-detected
    nuclear magnetic resonance and grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction. The
    results show a clear depth dependence of the phase transition on scales of a
    few microns. The measurements support a model in which there are tetragonal
    domains forming in the sample at temperatures much higher than the bulk
    phase transition temperature. Moreover, we find that these domains tend to
    form at higher temperatures preferentially near the free surface of the
    crystal. The details of the tetragonal domain formation and their
    depth/lateral dependencies are discussed.

    The magnetic properties of a 180-nm-thick epitaxial film of the dilute
    magnetic semiconductor Ga<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub> with x = 0.054 are
    investigated using beta-detected NMR of low-energy implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>. There is a broad distribution of local magnetic
    fields in the Ga<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub> layer, reflecting the magnetic
    inhomogeneity of the system. The resonance (representing the local magnetic
    field distribution) is followed as a function of temperature through the
    ferromagnetic transition. The average hyperfine field at the <sup>8</sup>Li
    nucleus is measured to be positive and on the order of 150 G at low
    temperature, implying a negative hyperfine coupling of the <sup>8</sup>Li to
    the delocalized holes and suggesting that the holes are better described by
    an Mn-derived impurity band. The spin-lattice relaxation of <sup>8</sup>Li
    shows a remarkably weak feature at the phase transition and no Korringa
    behavior despite metallic conductivity. No evidence is found of the
    microscopic magnetic phase separation that has been suggested by some
    low-energy muon spin-rotation measurements.

    Level-crossing resonances are observed for spin-polarized <sup>8</sup>Li in
    copper at 200 K. The positions of the resonances as a function of magnetic
    field and crystal orientation are a precise measure of the induced
    quadrupolar interaction on the nearest-neighbor Cu spins and provide
    unambiguous evidence that <sup>8</sup>Li occupies a substitutional site. The
    resonances are detected as enhancements in the <sup>8</sup>Li spin
    relaxation rate and are much broader than predicted from a static spin
    Hamiltonian. A strong collision model is used to extract a decoherence time
    as a result of the dipolar coupling of the <sup>8</sup>Li-Cu subsystem to
    the surrounding nuclear spin bath.

    We report β-NMR investigations of polarized <sup>8</sup>Li implanted in thin
    Pb and Ag/Nb films. At the critical superconducting temperature, we observe
    a singular peak in the spin relaxation rate in small longitudinal magnetic
    fields, which is attributed to unexpected slow fluctuations in the
    superconducting order parameter. The peak is several orders of magnitude
    larger than the prediction based on the enhancement of the dynamic electron
    spin susceptibility by superconducting fluctuations. The observed peak in
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> is rapidly suppressed in a small magnetic field,
    indicating that it is due to remarkably slow diamagnetic fluctuations which
    are undetectable with conventional NMR.

    We report β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) measurements of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted into high purity Pt. The frequency of
    the <sup>8</sup>Li β-NMR resonance and the spin-lattice relaxation rates
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> were measured at temperatures ranging from 3 to 300
    K. Remarkably, both the spin-lattice relaxation rate and the Knight shift
    <i>K</i> depend linearly on temperature <i>T</i> although the bulk
    susceptibility does not. <i>K</i> is found to scale with the Curie-Weiss
    dependence of the Pt susceptibility extrapolated to low temperatures. This
    is attributed to a defect response of the enhanced paramagnetism of Pt,
    i.e., the presence of the interstitial Li<sup>+</sup> locally relieves the
    tendency for the Curie-Weiss susceptibility to saturate at low <i>T</i>. We
    propose that the low temperature saturation in <i>χ</i> of Pt may be related
    to an interband coupling between the <i>s</i> and <i>d</i> bands that is
    disrupted locally by the presence of the Li<sup>+</sup>.

    We report the observation of weak magnetism in superlattices of
    LaAlO<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> using β-detected nuclear magnetic
    resonance. The spin lattice relaxation rate of <sup>8</sup>Li in
    superlattices with a spacer layers of 8 and 6 unit cells of
    LaAlO<sub>3</sub> exhibits a strong peak near ~35 K, whereas no such peak is
    observed in a superlattice with spacer layer thickness of 3 unit cells. We
    attribute the observed temperature dependence to slowing down of weakly
    coupled electronic moments at the LaAlO<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
    interface. These results show that the magnetism at the interface depends
    strongly on the thickness of the spacer layer, and that a minimal thickness
    of ~4-6 unit cells is required for the appearance of magnetism. A simple
    model is used to determine that the observed relaxation is due to small
    fluctuating moments (~0.002 μ<sub>B</sub>) in the two samples with a larger
    LaAlO<sub>3</sub> spacer thickness.

    We have measured the NMR of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted in a set of
    thin epitaxial films of Pd. We find a large, negative, strongly
    temperature-dependent Knight shift <i>K</i> consistent with previous
    measurements on polycrystalline films. The temperature dependence of the
    shift exhibits a characteristic deviation from the susceptibility
    <i>χ</i>(<i>T</i>). In particular, at low temperature, <i>K</i>(<i>T</i>)
    continues to follow a simple Curie-Weiss dependence. This result provides
    important insight into the origin of the low-temperature behavior of
    <i>χ</i>(<i>T</i>) in strongly paramagnetic metals. In addition, we find the
    room temperature shift depends on film thickness, with changes on the order
    of 20 % between films 100 nm and 30 nm thick. We also observe a
    surface-related resonance in both Au-capped and uncapped films with a small
    positive shift. These features bear a striking similarity to the Pt NMR line
    shapes in much smaller Pt particles. However, they seem to originate, not
    from adsorbed species, but rather in confinement effects on the highly
    exhange-enhanced Pd <i>d</i> band.

    The ratio of electric quadrupole moments of <sup>11</sup>Li and

    quadrupole resonance technique at TRIUMF-ISAC. The precision on the ratio

    than one order of magnitude and an absolute value for the quadrupole moment
    of <sup>11</sup>Li was inferred. Systematic effects, as argued here, are not
    expected to contribute to the ratio on this scale. The zero-field
    spin-lattice relaxation time for <sup>8</sup>Li implanted within
    SrTiO<sub>3</sub> at 295 K in zero-field was found to be
    <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> = 1.73(2) s. A comparison of the quadrupole moments of
    <sup>9,11</sup>Li and their ratio is made with the latest models, however,
    no conclusion may yet be drawn owing to the size of the theoretical

    β-Detected nuclear spin relaxation of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has been
    used to study the microscopic diffusion of lithium ions in thin films of
    poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), where the implanted lithium ions are present in
    extremely low concentration, and PEO with 30 wt %
    LiCF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> over a wide range of temperatures both above
    and below the glass transition temperature. Recent measurements by Do et al.
    [<i>Physical Review Letters</i> <b>2013</b>, 111, 018301] found that the
    temperature dependence of the Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity was identical to
    that of the dielectric α relaxation and was well described by the
    Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann relation, implying the α relaxation dominates the
    Li<sup>+</sup> transport process. In contrast, we find the hopping of
    Li<sup>+</sup> in both samples in the high temperature viscoelastic phase
    follows an Arrhenius law and depends significantly on the salt content. We
    propose that the hopping of Li<sup>+</sup> between cages involves motion of
    the polymer but that it is only for long-range diffusion where the α
    relaxation plays an important role.

    We report the NMR Knight shift and spin-lattice relaxation of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted ~100 nm into single crystals of
    semimetallic Sb, Bi, and topologically insulating
    Bi<sub>0.9</sub>Sb<sub>0.1</sub>. We find small negative shifts (of order
    100 ppm) in all three. In the insulator, the shift is nearly temperature
    independent, while in Bi and Sb it becomes more negative at low temperature
    without following the bulk susceptibility, suggesting two distinct
    temperature dependent contributions, possibly from the orbital and spin
    response. However, a simple model is unable to account for the observed
    shift. The spin-lattice relaxation differs in both scale and temperature
    dependence in all three. It is Korringa-like in Bi and remarkably is fastest
    in the insulating alloy and slowest in Sb with the highest bulk carrier
    density. These surprising results call for detailed calculations, but
    phenomenologically demonstrate that β-detected NMR of implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> is sensitive to the magnetic response of
    low-density carriers. The prospects for depth-resolved studies of
    conventional and topological surface states at lower implantation energies
    are good.

    β-detected nuclear spin relaxation of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has been
    used to probe the depth dependence of molecular dynamics in high- and
    low-molecular-weight deuterated polystyrene. The average nuclear
    spin-lattice relaxation rate, 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub><sup>avg</sup>, is a
    measure of the spectral density of the polymer motion at the Larmor
    frequency (41 MHz at 6.55 T). In both samples,
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub><sup>avg</sup> is depth independent below ~200 K but
    above this temperature it decreases approximately exponentially with
    distance from the free surface, returning to bulk behavior for depths
    greater than ~10 nm. This is direct evidence for a region near the free
    surface with enhanced molecular dynamics compared with the bulk. The
    effective thickness of the surface region increases with increasing
    temperature and is finite even above the glass transition. These results
    present challenges for the current understanding of dynamics near the
    surface of polymer glasses.

    incommensurate spin fluctuations. The nuclear relaxation rate can be
    explained using previously published bulk <sup>17</sup>O NMR and inelastic
    neutron spectroscopy measurements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility to
    model the hyperfine coupling. A well-resolved quadrupolar-split NMR for
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implies a static stopping position in an
    interstitial site. The <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> Knight shift is highly
    sensitive to the anisotropic static susceptibility.

    Considerable evidence suggests that variations in the properties of
    topological insulators (TIs) at the nanoscale and at interfaces can strongly
    affect the physics of topological materials. Therefore, a detailed
    understanding of surface states and interface coupling is crucial to the
    search for and applications of new topological phases of matter. Currently,
    no methods can provide depth profiling near surfaces or at interfaces of
    topologically inequivalent materials. Such a method could advance the study
    of interactions. Herein, we present a noninvasive depth-profiling technique
    based on β-detected NMR (β-NMR) spectroscopy of radioactive
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> ions that can provide "one-dimensional imaging"
    in films of fixed thickness and generates nanoscale views of the electronic
    wavefunctions and magnetic order at topological surfaces and interfaces. By
    mapping the <sup>8</sup>Li nuclear resonance near the surface and 10-nm deep
    into the bulk of pure and Cr-doped bismuth antimony telluride films, we
    provide signatures related to the TI properties and their topological
    nontrivial characteristics that affect the electron-nuclear hyperfine field,
    the metallic shift, and magnetic order. These nanoscale variations in β-NMR
    parameters reflect the unconventional properties of the topological
    materials under study, and understanding the role of heterogeneities is
    expected to lead to the discovery of novel phenomena involving quantum
    materials.

    We present β-detected NMR measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted into an epitaxial heterostructure based
    on a 100 nm thick film of ferromagnetic (FM) EuO as a function of
    temperature through its FM transition. In the FM state, the spin-lattice
    relaxation rate follows the same temperature dependence, determined by
    magnon scattering mechanisms, observed in the bulk by <sup>153</sup>Eu NMR,
    but above 40 K, the signal is wiped out. We also find that
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> stopped in material adjacent to the magnetic
    layer exhibits spin relaxation related to the critical slowing of the Eu
    spins. A particularly strong relaxation in the Au overlayer suggests an
    unusual strong nonlocal coupling mechanism to <sup>8</sup>Li in the metal.

    By measuring the prototypical antiferromagnet α−Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
    we show that it is possible to determine the static spin orientation and
    dynamic spin correlations within nanometers from an antiferromagnetic
    surface using the nuclear spin polarization of implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> ions detected with β-NMR. Remarkably, the
    first-order Morin spin reorientation in single crystal
    α−Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> occurs at the same temperature at all depths
    between 1 and 100 nm from the (110) surface; however, the implanted nuclear
    spin experiences an increased 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> relaxation rate at
    shallow depths revealing soft-surface magnons. The surface-localized
    dynamics decay towards the bulk with a characteristic length of <i>ε</i> =
    11 ± 1  nm, closely matching the finite-size thresholds of hematite
    nanostructures.

    β-detected NMR (β-NMR) has been used to study the molecular-scale dynamics
    of lithium ions in thin films of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) containing
    either lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) or lithium
    trifluoroacetate (LiTFA) salts at monomer-to-salt ratios (EO/Li) of 8.3. The
    results are compared with previous β-NMR measurements on pure PEO and PEO
    with lithium triflate (LiOTf) at the same loading [McKenzie et al., J. Am.
    Chem. Soc. <b>136</b>, 7833 (2014)]. Activated hopping of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> was observed in all of the films above ~250 K,
    with the hopping parameters strongly correlated with the ionicity of the
    lithium salt rather than the polymer glass transition temperature. The
    pre-exponential factor increases exponentially with ionicity, while the
    activation energy for hopping increases approximately linearly, going from
    6.3 ± 0.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> in PEO:LiTFA to 17.8 ± 0.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>
    in PEO:LiTFSI. The more rapid increase in the pre-exponential factor
    outweighs the effect of the larger activation energy and results in
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> hopping being fastest in PEO followed by
    PEO:LiTFSI, PEO:LiOTf, and PEO:LiTFA.

    Diffusion of Li<sup>+</sup> in (111) oriented thin films of the spinels
    Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> and LiTi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
    has been studied with <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected NMR in the temperature range
    between 5 and 310 K. In Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, the
    spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) versus temperature
    shows a clear maximum around 100 K (= <i>T</i><sub>max</sub>) which we
    attribute to magnetic freezing of dilute Ti<sup>3+</sup> local magnetic
    moments, consistent with the results of magnetization and muon spin
    relaxation (μ<sup>+</sup>SR) measurements. The decrease in
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> with temperature above <i>T</i><sub>max</sub>
    indicates that Li<sup>+</sup> starts to diffuse with a thermal activation
    energy (<i>E<sub>a</sub></i>) of 0.11(1) eV. In
    LiTi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, on the contrary, as temperature increases
    from 200 K, 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> increases monotonically up to 310 K. This
    suggests that Li also starts to diffuse above 200 K with
    <i>E<sub>a</sub></i> = 0.16(2) eV in LiTi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.
    Comparison with conventional Li-NMR on
    Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> implies that both β-NMR and
    μ<sup>+</sup>SR sense short-range Li motion, i.e., a jump diffusion of
    Li<sup>+</sup> to the nearest neighboring sites.

    We report measurements of the dynamics of isolated
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in single crystal rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> using
    β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation and
    motional narrowing, we find two sets of thermally activated dynamics: one
    below 100 K and one at higher temperatures. At low temperature, the
    activation barrier is 26.8(6) meV with prefactor 1.23(5) × 10<sup>10</sup>
    s<sup>-1</sup>. We suggest this is unrelated to Li<sup>+</sup> motion and
    rather is a consequence of electron polarons in the vicinity of the
    implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> that are known to become mobile in this
    temperature range. Above 100 K, Li<sup>+</sup> undergoes long-range
    diffusion as an isolated uncomplexed cation, characterized by an activation
    energy and prefactor of 0.32(2) eV and 1.0(5) × 10<sup>16</sup>
    s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, in agreement with macroscopic diffusion
    measurements. These results in the dilute limit from a microscopic probe
    indicate that Li<sup>+</sup> concentration does not limit the diffusivity
    even up to high concentrations but that some key ingredient is missing in
    the calculations of the migration barrier. The anomalous prefactors provide
    further insight into both Li<sup>+</sup> and polaron motion.

    There is indirect evidence that the dynamics of a polymer near a free
    surface are enhanced compared with the bulk but there are few studies of how
    dynamics varies with depth. β-Detected nuclear spin relaxation of implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has been used to directly probe the temperature
    and depth dependence of the γ-relaxation mode, which is due to phenyl rings
    undergoing restricted rotation, in thin films of atactic deuterated
    polystyrene (PS-d8) and determine how the depth dependence of dynamics is
    affected by sample processing, such as annealing, floating on water and the
    inclusion of a surfactant, and by the presence of a buried interface. The
    activation energy for the γ-relaxation process is lower near the free
    surface. Annealing the PS-d8 films and then immersing in water to mimic the
    floating procedure used to transfer films had negligible effects on the
    thickness of the region near the free surface with enhanced mobility.
    Measurements on a bilayer film indicate enhanced phenyl ring dynamics near
    the buried interface compared with a single film at the same depth. PS-d8
    films annealed with the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) deposited on
    the surface show enhanced dynamics in the bulk compared with a pure PS-d8
    film and a PS-d8 film where the SDS was washed away. There is less contrast
    between the surface and bulk in the SDS-treated sample, which could account
    for the elimination of the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> confinement effect observed
    in films containing SDS [Chen and Torkelson, <i>Polymer</i>, 2016,
    <b>87</b>, 226].

    electronic properties of the three-dimensional topological insulator
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>Se using ion-implanted <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected
    nuclear magnetic relaxation and resonance. With implantation energies in the
    range 5-28 keV, the probes penetrate beyond the expected range of the
    topological surface state, but are still within 250 nm of the surface. At
    temperatures above ~150K, spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal
    isolated <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion with an activation energy
    <i>E<sub>A</sub></i> = 0.185(8) eV and attempt frequency
    <i>τ</i><sub>0</sub><sup>−1</sup> = 8 ± 3 × 10<sup>11</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>
    for atomic site-to-site hopping. At lower temperature, we find a linear
    Korringa-type relaxation mechanism with a field-dependent slope and
    intercept, which is accompanied by an anomalous field dependence to the
    resonance shift. We suggest that these may be related to a strong
    contribution from orbital currents or the magnetic freeze-out of charge
    carriers in this heavily compensated semiconductor, but that conventional
    theories are unable to account for the extent of the field dependence.
    Conventional NMR of the stable host nuclei may help elucidate their origin.

    We report measurements of the diffusion rate of isolated ion-implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> within ~120  nm of the surface of oriented

    particles from the <sup>8</sup>Li decay provide a sensitive monitor of the
    distance from the surface and how the depth profile of <sup>8</sup>Li
    evolves with time. The main findings are that the implanted Li<sup>+</sup>
    diffuses and traps at the (001) surface. The <i>T</i> dependence of the
    diffusivity is described by a bi-Arrhenius expression with activation
    energies of 0.3341(21) eV above 200 K, whereas at lower temperatures it has
    a much smaller barrier of 0.0313(15) eV. We consider possible origins for
    the surface trapping, as well the nature of the low-<i>T</i> barrier.

    We report β-detected NMR of ion-implanted <sup>8</sup>Li in a single crystal
    and thin film of the strongly correlated metal LaNiO<sub>3</sub>.
    Spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal two distinct local environments,
    both metallic as evident from <i>T</i>-linear Korringa
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> below 200 K with slopes comparable to other metals. A
    small approximately temperature-independent Knight shift of ~74 ppm is
    observed, yielding a normalized Korringa product characteristic of
    substantial antiferromagnetic correlations. We find no evidence for a
    magnetic transition from 4 to 310 K. The similarity of these features in the
    two very different samples indicates that they are intrinsic and unrelated
    to dilute oxygen vacancies. We attribute the two environments to two
    distinct but similar crystallographic <sup>8</sup>Li sites and not to any
    form of phase inhomogeneity, but this is inconsistent with the conventional
    rhombohedral structure of LaNiO<sub>3</sub>, and also cannot be simply
    explained by the common alternative orthorhombic or monoclinic distortions.

    We demonstrate the application of implanted-ion β-detected NMR as a probe of
    ionic liquid molecular dynamics through the measurement of <sup>8</sup>Li
    spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) and resonance in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
    acetate. The motional narrowing of the resonance and the local maxima in the
    SLR rate, 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, imply sensitivity to subnanosecond
    Li<sup>+</sup> solvation dynamics. From an analysis of
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, we extract an activation energy <i>E<sub>A</sub></i>
    = 74.8(1.5) meV and Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann constant <i>T</i><sub>VFT</sub> =
    165.8(0.9) K, in agreement with the dynamic viscosity of the bulk solvent.
    Near the melting point, the lineshape is broad and intense, and the form of
    the relaxation is nonexponential, reflective of our sensitivity to
    heterogeneous dynamics near the glass transition. The depth resolution of
    this technique may later provide a unique means of studying nanoscale
    phenomena in ionic liquids.

    We have studied a mosaic of 1T-CrSe<sub>2</sub> single crystals using
    β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance of <sup>8</sup>Li from 4 to 300 K. We
    identify two broad resonances that show no evidence of quadrupolar
    splitting, indicating two magnetically distinct environments for the
    implanted ion. We observe stretched exponential spin lattice relaxation and
    a corresponding rate (1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) that increases monotonically
    above 200 K, consistent with the onset of ionic diffusion. A pronounced
    maximum in 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> is observed at the low temperature
    magnetic transition near 20 K. Between these limits, 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>
    exhibits a broad minimum with an anomalous absence of strong features in the
    vicinity of structural and magnetic transitions between 150 and 200 K.
    Together, the results suggest <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> site occupation
    within the van der Waals gap between CrSe<sub>2</sub> trilayers. Possible
    origins of the two environments are discussed.

    We report β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) measurements in
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>:Ca (BSC) and Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>:Mn
    (BTM) single crystals using <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted to depths
    on the order of 100 nm. Above ~200 K, spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) reveals
    diffusion of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>, with activation energies of ~0.4 eV
    (~0.2 eV) in BSC (BTM). At lower temperatures, the nuclear magnetic
    resonance (NMR) properties are those of a heavily doped semiconductor in the
    metallic limit, with Korringa relaxation and a small, negative,
    temperature-dependent Knight shift in BSC. From this, we make a detailed
    comparison with the isostructural tetradymite Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>Se
    (BTS) [McFadden et al., Phys Rev. B <b>99</b>, 125201 (2019)]. In the magnetic BTM,
    the effects of the dilute Mn moments predominate, but remarkably the
    <sup>8</sup>Li signal is not wiped out through the magnetic transition at 13
    K, with a prominent critical peak in the SLR that is suppressed in a high
    applied field. This detailed characterization of the <sup>8</sup>Li NMR
    response is an important step towards using depth-resolved β-NMR to study
    the low-energy properties of the chiral topological surface state (TSS).
    With the bulk NMR response now established in several
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Ch<sub>3</sub> tetradymite topological insulators (TIs), the
    prospect of directly probing their chiral TSS using the depth resolution
    afforded by β-NMR remains strong.

    <i>T</i>-dependence. The metallic character of the slow relaxing component
    is only weakly affected by the LaNiO<sub>3</sub> thickness, while the fast

    dependence (increasing towards low <i>T</i>) in the thinnest, most magnetic
    samples. The origin of this bipartite relaxation is discussed in terms of

    We investigated the depth, temperature, and molecular-weight (MW) dependence
    of the γ-relaxation in polystyrene glasses using implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> and β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance.
    Measurements were performed on thin films with MW ranging from 1.1 to
    641 kg/mol. The temperature dependence of the average <sup>8</sup>Li
    spin–lattice relaxation time (<i>T</i><sub>1</sub><sup>avg</sup>) was
    measured near the free surface and in the bulk. Spin–lattice relaxation is
    caused by phenyl ring flips, which involve transitions between local minima
    over free-energy barriers with enthalpic and entropic contributions. We used
    transition state theory to model the temperature dependence of the
    γ-relaxation, and hence <i>T</i><sub>1</sub><sup>avg</sup>.
    There is no clear correlation of the average
    entropy of activation (<i>Δ<sup>‡</sup>S̄</i>) and enthalpy of activation
    (<i>Δ<sup>‡</sup>H̄</i>) with MW, but there is a clear correlation between
    <i>Δ<sup>‡</sup>S̄</i> and <i>Δ<sup>‡</sup>H̄</i>, i.e., entropy–enthalpy
    compensation. This results in the average Gibbs energy of activation,
    <i>Δ<sup>‡</sup>Ḡ</i>, being approximately independent of MW. Measurements
    of the temperature dependence of <i>T</i><sub>1</sub><sup>avg</sup> as a
    function of depth below the free surface indicate the inherent entropic
    barrier, i.e., the entropy of activation corresponding to
    <i>Δ<sup>‡</sup>H̄</i> = 0, has an exponential dependence on the distance
    from the free surface before reaching the bulk value. This results in
    <i>Δ<sup>‡</sup>Ḡ</i> near the free surface being lower than the bulk.
    Combining these observations results in a model where the average
    fluctuation rate of the γ-relaxation has a “double-exponential” depth
    dependence. This model can explain the depth dependence of
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub><sup>avg</sup> in polystyrene films. The
    characteristic length of enhanced dynamics is ~6 nm and approximately
    independent of MW near room temperature.

    Currently, no known material retains its photoinduced metallic conductivity
    over a long time while also exhibiting repeatable metal-to-insulator
    recovery. Here, we demonstrate such a highly repeatable photoinduced
    insulator-to-metal transition in yttrium oxyhydride
    (YO<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub>) epitaxial thin films. The temperature
    (<i>T</i>) dependence of the electrical resistivity (<i>ρ</i>) of the films
    transforms from the insulating to the metallic state
    (d<i>ρ</i>/d<i>T</i> > 0) under ultraviolet laser illumination. The
    YO<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub> film recovers its original insulating state when
    heated (125 °C) under an Ar atmosphere and regains metallic conductivity
    when subsequently subjected to ultraviolet laser illumination again, showing
    a repeatable photoinduced insulator-to-metal transition. First-principles
    calculations show that the itinerant carriers originate from the variations
    in the charge states of the hydrogen atoms that occupy octahedral
    interstitial sites. This study indicates that tuning the site occupancy
    (octahedral/tetrahedral) of the hydrogen atoms exerts a significant effect
    on the photoresponse of metal hydrides.

    The complexation of Mg<sup>II</sup> with adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is
    omnipresent in biochemical energy conversion, but is difficult to
    interrogate directly. Here we used the spin-1/2 β-emitter <sup>31</sup>Mg to
    study Mg<sup>II</sup>-ATP complexation in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
    acetate (EMIM-Ac) solutions using β-radiation-detected nuclear magnetic
    resonance (β-NMR). We demonstrate that (nuclear) spin-polarized
    <sup>31</sup>Mg, following ion-implantation from an accelerator beamline
    into EMIM-Ac, binds to ATP within its radioactive lifetime before
    depolarizing. The evolution of the spectra with solute concentration
    indicates that the implanted <sup>31</sup>Mg initially bind to the solvent
    acetate anions, whereafter they undergo dynamic exchange and form either a
    mono- (<sup>31</sup>Mg-ATP) or di-nuclear (<sup>31</sup>MgMg-ATP) complex.
    The chemical shift of <sup>31</sup>Mg-ATP is observed up-field of
    <sup>31</sup>MgMg-ATP, in accord with quantum chemical calculations. These
    observations constitute a crucial advance towards using β-NMR to probe
    biologically relevant contexts.

    <sup>8</sup>Li in single crystals of the semiconductor ZnO using β-detected
    nuclear magnetic resonance. At ultradilute concentrations, the spectra
    reveal distinct Li sites from 7.6 to 400 K. Ionized shallow donor
    interstitial Li is stable across the entire temperature range, confirming
    its ability to self-compensate the acceptor character of its (Zn)
    substitutional counterpart. Above 300 K, spin-lattice relaxation indicates
    the onset of correlated local motion of interacting defects, and the spectra
    show a site change transition from disordered configurations to
    substitutional. Like the interstitial, the substitutional shows no resolved
    hyperfine splitting, indicating it is also fully ionized above 210 K. The
    electric field gradient at the interstitial <sup>8</sup>Li exhibits
    substantial temperature dependence with a power law typical of non-cubic
    metals.

    A new high field spectrometer has been built to extend the capabilities of
    the β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) facility at TRIUMF. This
    new beamline extension allows β-NMR spectroscopy to be performed with fields
    up to 200 mT parallel to a sample's surface (perpendicular to the ion beam),
    allowing depth-resolved studies of local electromagnetic fields with spin
    polarized probes at a much higher applied magnetic field than previously
    available in this configuration. The primary motivation and application is
    to allow studies of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) materials, close
    to the critical fields of Nb metal, which is extensively used to fabricate
    SRF cavities. The details of the design considerations and implementation of
    the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system, ion optics, beam diagnostics are
    presented here. Commissioning of the beamline and spectrometer with
    radioactive ions are also reported here. Future capabilities and
    applications in other areas are also described.

    We report measurements of the Meissner screening profile in a
    Nb(300 nm)/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin film using <sup>8</sup>Li
    β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR). The NMR probe <sup>8</sup>Li
    was ion-implanted into the Nb film at energies ≤ 20 keV, corresponding to
    mean stopping depths comparable to Nb's magnetic penetration depth <i>λ</i>.
    <sup>8</sup>Li's strong dipole-dipole coupling with the host <sup>93</sup>Nb
    nuclei provided a "cross-relaxation" channel that dominated in low magnetic
    fields, which conferred indirect sensitivity to the local magnetic field via
    the spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) rate 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>. From a fit of
    the 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> data to a model accounting for its dependence on
    temperature, magnetic field, and <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implantation
    energy, we obtained a magnetic penetration depth <i>λ</i><sub>0</sub> =
    51.5(22) nm, consistent with a relatively short carrier mean-free-path
    <i>ℓ</i> = 18.7(29) nm typical of similarly prepared Nb films. The results

    We report β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance of ultra-dilute
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite
    (HOPG). The absence of motional narrowing and diffusional spin-lattice
    relaxation implies Li<sup>+</sup> is not appreciably mobile up to 400 K, in
    sharp contrast to the highly lithiated stage compounds. However, the
    relaxation is remarkably fast and persists down to cryogenic temperatures.
    Ruling out extrinsic paramagnetic impurities and intrinsic ferromagnetism,
    we conclude the relaxation is due to paramagnetic centers correlated with
    implantation. While the resulting effects are not consistent with a Kondo
    impurity, they also differ from free paramagnetic centers, and we suggest
    that a resonant scattering approach may account for much of the observed
    phenomenology.

    We report direct measurements of the magnetic field screening at the limits
    of the Meissner phase for two superconducting Nb samples. The samples are
    processed with two different surface treatments that have been developed for
    superconducting radio-frequency cavity applications - a "baseline" treatment
    and an oxygen-doping ("O-doping") treatment. The measurements show: 1) that
    the screening length is significantly longer in the "O-doping" sample
    compared to the "baseline" sample; 2) that the screening length near the
    limits of the Meissner phase increases with applied field; 3) the evolution
    of the screening profile as the material transitions from the Meissner phase
    to the mixed phase; and 4) a demonstration of the absence of any screening
    profile for the highest applied field, indicative of the full flux entering
    the sample. Measurements are performed utilizing the -detected nuclear
    magnetic resonance (β-NMR) technique that allows depth resolved studies of
    the local magnetic field within the first 100 nm of the surface. The study
    takes advantage of the β-SRF beamline, a new facility at TRIUMF, Canada,
    where field levels up to 200 mT are available parallel to the sample
    surface to replicate radio frequency (RF) fields near the Meissner breakdown
    limits of Nb.

    We report β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) measurements of
    implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in a synthetic single crystal of
    α-SiO<sub>2</sub> (quartz). At 6.55 Tesla, the spectrum is comprised of a
    large amplitude broad resonance and a quadrupolar multiplet that is only
    revealed by an RF comb excitation. The quadrupole splitting is surprisingly
    small, increases with temperature, and provides information on the
    implantation site. Supercell density functional theory calculations show
    that the small EFG is consistent with an in-channel interstitial site
    (Wyckoff 3<it>a</it>). The spin-lattice relaxation is unexpectedly fast and
    strongly temperature dependent with a diffusive peak above 200 K and a
    second more prominent relaxation peak at lower temperature. Analysis of the
    diffusive relaxation yields an activation barrier 178(43) meV for the
    isolated Li<sup>+</sup>, in the range of other measurements and
    calculations. To account for many of the other features of the data, it is
    suggested that some of the implanted ions trap an electron forming the
    neutral Li<sup>0</sup>, which is stable over a narrow range of temperatures.

    We report measurements of the normal-state and superconducting properties of
    thin-film Nb<sub>1−x</sub>Ti<sub>x</sub>N using <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected
    nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR). In these experiments, radioactive
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> probes were implanted ∼21 nm below the surface of
    a Nb<sub>1−x</sub>Ti<sub>x</sub>N(91 nm) film in
    Nb<sub>0.75</sub>Ti<sub>0.25</sub>N(91 nm)/AlN(4 nm)/Nb and its NMR response
    recorded (via <sup>8</sup>Li's β-emissions) between 4.6 K and 270 K in a
    4.1 T field applied normal to its surface. Resonance measurements reveal
    wide, symmetric lineshapes at all temperatures, with significant additional
    broadening below the film's superconducting transition temperature
    <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>(0 T) = 15.4 ± 0.7 K due to vortex lattice formation.
    Fits to a broadening model find a magnetic penetration depth
    <i>λ</i>(0 K) = 180.57 ± 0.30 nm and upper critical field
    <i>B</i><sub>c2</sub>(0 K) = 18 ± 4 T, consistent with literature estimates.
    Spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) measurements find a Korringa response at low
    temperatures, with dynamic (i.e., thermally activated) contributions
    dominating above ∼100 K. Below <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>, we observe a small H
    bel-Slichter coherence peak characterized by a superconducting energy gap
    <i>Δ</i>(0 K) = 2.60 ± 0.12 meV and modest Dynes-like broadening. Our
    measurements suggest a gap ratio
    2<i>Δ</i>(0 K)/<i>k</i><sub>B</sub><i>T</i><sub>c</sub>(0 T) = 3.92 ± 0.25,
    consistent with strong-coupling behavior. Sources for the dynamic
    high-<i>T</i> relaxation are suggested.

    Dynamics from the surface to the bulk in ultrastable and liquid-cooled

    Ultrastable glasses (USGs) exhibit strikingly different properties from
    liquid-cooled normal glasses (NGs), yet their molecular dynamics remain
    poorly understood. Using β-detected NMR of implanted spin-polarized
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>, we directly track the depth and temperature
    dependence of the γ relaxation—phenyl ring twisting—in highly monodisperse
    atactic styrene oligomers. Near the bulk glass transition temperature
    <i>T</i><sub>g</sub>, USGs show much faster surface dynamics but slower bulk
    dynamics than an NG. Cooling below <i>𝑇</i><sub>g</sub> reveals a sharp
    crossover at <i>T</i><sup>*</sup>, where surface dynamics vitrify on tens to
    hundreds of nanosecond timescales and become slower than in the bulk. The NG
    further displays two distinct <i>T</i><sup>*</sup> values near the surface,
    pointing to heterogeneous local structure. Despite these differences, all
    dynamics obey entropy-enthalpy compensation, suggesting a common molecular
    mechanism. These results show that preparation and thermal history lock
    styrene oligomeric glasses into distinct regions of the potential energy
    landscape, giving rise to fundamentally different glassy dynamics.
