    Used to store the results of μSR measurements at TRIUMF, the Muon Data (MUD)
    file format serves as a useful and flexible scheme that is both lightweight
    and self-describing. The application programming interface (API) for these
    files is written in C and FORTRAN, languages not known for their ease of
    use. In contrast, Python is a language which emphasizes rapid prototyping
    and readability. This work describes three Python 3 packages to interface
    with MUD files and analyze their contents: mudpy, bdata, and bfit. The first
    enables easy access to the contents of any MUD file. The latter two are
    implemented specifically for the implanted-ion β-detected NMR (β-NMR)
    experiment at TRIUMF. These tools provide both an API and graphical user
    interface (GUI) to help users extract and fit β-NMR data.

    We investigate the behavior of interstitial <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>
    implanted near the surface of 2H-MoTe<sub>2</sub> using β-detected NMR. We
    find that, unlike the muon, <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> does not show any
    signature of induced magnetism. This result is consistent with density
    functional theory, which identifies the Li stopping site at the 2a Wyckoff
    position in the van der Waals gap and confirms the absence of detectable
    Li-induced electronic spin polarization. Both the spin-lattice relaxation
    and the resonance lines show evidence of strong spin dynamics above ∼200 K,
    reminiscent of local stochastic <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> motion within a
    cage. The resonance line shape consists of quadrupolar satellites on top of
    a broad central peak. To better understand the interaction of 8Li+ with the
    host material, we employ a frequency-comb measurement, by simultaneously
    exciting four frequencies corresponding to the first-order quadrupolar
    satellite transitions, ν<sub>0</sub> ± 3ν<sub>comb</sub> and
    ν<sub>0</sub> ± ν<sub>comb</sub> around the Larmor frequency ν<sub>0</sub>
    as a function of ν<sub>comb</sub>. This offers an enhanced sensitivity to
    the quadrupolar split portion of the line. Using this method, we find a
    small decrease of the quadrupolar frequency with increasing temperature,
    showing the typical behavior associated with thermally excited phonons and
    the absence of any magnetic response which was observed with other defects
    in 2H-MoTe<sub>2</sub>.
