    Used to store the results of μSR measurements at TRIUMF, the Muon Data (MUD)
    file format serves as a useful and flexible scheme that is both lightweight
    and self-describing. The application programming interface (API) for these
    files is written in C and FORTRAN, languages not known for their ease of
    use. In contrast, Python is a language which emphasizes rapid prototyping
    and readability. This work describes three Python 3 packages to interface
    with MUD files and analyze their contents: mudpy, bdata, and bfit. The first
    enables easy access to the contents of any MUD file. The latter two are
    implemented specifically for the implanted-ion β-detected NMR (β-NMR)
    experiment at TRIUMF. These tools provide both an API and graphical user
    interface (GUI) to help users extract and fit β-NMR data.

    We report β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) measurements of
    implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in a synthetic single crystal of
    α-SiO<sub>2</sub> (quartz). At 6.55 Tesla, the spectrum is comprised of a
    large amplitude broad resonance and a quadrupolar multiplet that is only
    revealed by an RF comb excitation. The quadrupole splitting is surprisingly
    small, increases with temperature, and provides information on the
    implantation site. Supercell density functional theory calculations show
    that the small EFG is consistent with an in-channel interstitial site
    (Wyckoff 3<it>a</it>). The spin-lattice relaxation is unexpectedly fast and
    strongly temperature dependent with a diffusive peak above 200 K and a
    second more prominent relaxation peak at lower temperature. Analysis of the
    diffusive relaxation yields an activation barrier 178(43) meV for the
    isolated Li<sup>+</sup>, in the range of other measurements and
    calculations. To account for many of the other features of the data, it is
    suggested that some of the implanted ions trap an electron forming the
    neutral Li<sup>0</sup>, which is stable over a narrow range of temperatures.
