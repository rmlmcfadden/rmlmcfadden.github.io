    Used to store the results of μSR measurements at TRIUMF, the Muon Data (MUD)
    file format serves as a useful and flexible scheme that is both lightweight
    and self-describing. The application programming interface (API) for these
    files is written in C and FORTRAN, languages not known for their ease of
    use. In contrast, Python is a language which emphasizes rapid prototyping
    and readability. This work describes three Python 3 packages to interface
    with MUD files and analyze their contents: mudpy, bdata, and bfit. The first
    enables easy access to the contents of any MUD file. The latter two are
    implemented specifically for the implanted-ion β-detected NMR (β-NMR)
    experiment at TRIUMF. These tools provide both an API and graphical user
    interface (GUI) to help users extract and fit β-NMR data.

    We report measurements of the normal-state and superconducting properties of
    thin-film Nb<sub>1−x</sub>Ti<sub>x</sub>N using <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected
    nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR). In these experiments, radioactive
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> probes were implanted ∼21 nm below the surface of
    a Nb<sub>1−x</sub>Ti<sub>x</sub>N(91 nm) film in
    Nb<sub>0.75</sub>Ti<sub>0.25</sub>N(91 nm)/AlN(4 nm)/Nb and its NMR response
    recorded (via <sup>8</sup>Li's β-emissions) between 4.6 K and 270 K in a
    4.1 T field applied normal to its surface. Resonance measurements reveal
    wide, symmetric lineshapes at all temperatures, with significant additional
    broadening below the film's superconducting transition temperature
    <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>(0 T) = 15.4 ± 0.7 K due to vortex lattice formation.
    Fits to a broadening model find a magnetic penetration depth
    <i>λ</i>(0 K) = 180.57 ± 0.30 nm and upper critical field
    <i>B</i><sub>c2</sub>(0 K) = 18 ± 4 T, consistent with literature estimates.
    Spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) measurements find a Korringa response at low
    temperatures, with dynamic (i.e., thermally activated) contributions
    dominating above ∼100 K. Below <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>, we observe a small H
    bel-Slichter coherence peak characterized by a superconducting energy gap
    <i>Δ</i>(0 K) = 2.60 ± 0.12 meV and modest Dynes-like broadening. Our
    measurements suggest a gap ratio
    2<i>Δ</i>(0 K)/<i>k</i><sub>B</sub><i>T</i><sub>c</sub>(0 T) = 3.92 ± 0.25,
    consistent with strong-coupling behavior. Sources for the dynamic
    high-<i>T</i> relaxation are suggested.
