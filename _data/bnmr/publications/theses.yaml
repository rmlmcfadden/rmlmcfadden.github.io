    This thesis is a presentation of experiments examining the induced hyperfine
    magnetism in the nonmagnetic layers of two thin film magnetic multilayers,
    Au(40 Å)/Ag(200 Å)/Fe(140 Å) and Au(40 Å)/Ag(800 Å)/Fe(20 Å) grown on GaAs
    (001) single crystal substrates. The main technique used in this study was
    beta-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (βNMR) conducted at TRIUMF
    laboratories in Vancouver, British Columbia. βNMR makes NMR measurements on
    radioactive <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> (<i>τ</i> = 1.21 sec) nuclei that are
    implanted directly into the sample. Resonant βNMR experiments showed strong
    induced magnetism in the non-magnetic Ag layer due the magnetic Fe.
    Comparison of a theoretical model to experimental results on the
    Au(40 Å)/Ag(200 Å)/Fe(140 Å) sample suggest that the induced hyperfine
    magnetism decays with distance into the Ag layer from the
    magnetic/nonmagnetic interface like <i>x</i><sup>-1.84</sup> from a maximum of
    ~0.3 T at the magnetic/nonmagnetic interface.

    Measurement of the London penetration depth in the Meissner state of
    NbSe<sub>2</sub> using low energy polarized <sup>8</sup>Li
  author:
    - M. M. Hossain
  abstract: >-
    In this thesis, the Meissner state of NbSe<sub>2</sub> was investigated
    using low energy beam of spin polarized <sup>8</sup>Li. The <sup>8</sup>Li
    nuclear spin relaxation rate 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> was measured as a
    function of temperature and magnetic field. The spin relaxation rate is
    sensitive to low frequency nuclear spin dynamics of the host Nb spins and is
    strongly field dependent. This is used to determine the reduction in the
    magnetic field upon cooling into the Meissner state. Using a calculated
    implantation profile and a model field distribution, one can extract a
    measure of the absolute value of the London penetration depth <i>λ</i> in
    Meissner state. In addition, a model field distribution, assuming a
    suppression of order parameter near surface, was developed. In this case, we
    can extract another length scale which is related to the "coherence" length
    <i>ξ</i>. The value of <i>λ</i> depends on the model field distribution but
    is significantly longer than that obtained previously in the vortex state
    using μSR. From the measured internal magnetic field distribution, London
    penetration <i>λ<sub>L</sub></i> is extracted as a function of temperature.
    There is also evidence of the coherence peak in 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> of
    host nuclear spins. <i>λ<sub>L</sub></i>(<i>T</i>) follows the two-fluid
    model of superconductivity. Depending on the model for internal field
    distribution, <i>λ<sub>L</sub></i>(0) varies in the range (1795-2434) Å.

    Near surface vortex lattice in NbSe<sub>2</sub> studied with low energy
    beta-NMR
  author:
    - D. Wang
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    In this thesis, the magnetic field distribution in the vortex state of
    NbSe<sub>2</sub> is investigated with the technique of depth resolved
    β-detected NMR using a beam of highly polarized <sup>8</sup>Li produced at
    the TRIUMF ISAC facility. The β-NMR lineshape is a direct measure of the
    local magnetic field distribution weighted according to the implantation
    profile of the <sup>8</sup>Li beam. By varying the implantation energy
    between 1 ~ 30 keV, one can control the average implantation depth
    corresponds in a range between 5 ~ 136 nm. Above <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> = 7.0
    K a relatively narrow resonance is observed whose width is attributed to
    magnetic dipolar broadening from the <sup>93</sup>Nb nuclear moments. Below
    <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> a much broader asymmetric lineshape is observed, which
    is characteristic of a triangular magnetic vortex lattice. Modeling the
    magnetic field distribution allows one to determine both the effective in
    plane penetration depth <i>λ</i><sub>||</sub> and the effective in plane
    coherence length <i>ξ</i><sub>||</sub> or vortex core radius.
    </p>
    <p>
    In a magnetic field of 302 mT, we obtain <i>λ</i><sub>||</sub> = 279(30) nm
    and <i>ξ</i><sub>||</sub> = 12(1) nm. In a smaller magnetic field of 10.84
    mT, the effective coherence length increases dramatically to a value of
    77(10) nm. This is more than an order of magnitude larger than the expected
    from the coherence length in NbSe<sub>2</sub>. The origin of the giant
    vortices is discussed. We propose an explanation involving the multiband
    nature of NbSe<sub>2</sub>.

    Magnetic properties near the surface of cuprate superconductors studied
    using beta-detected NMR
  author:
    - H. Saadaoui
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    Beta-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (β-NMR) uses highly spin polarized
    β-emitting nuclei as a probe. Besides its use in nuclear physics, it has
    also become a powerful and sensitive tool in condensed matter physics and
    materials science. At TRIUMF, β-NMR of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has been
    developed to study materials in a depth-resolved manner, where the
    implantation depth of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> is controlled via
    electrostatic deceleration. In this thesis, β-NMR of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has been used to study high-<i>T<sub>c</sub></i>
    cuprate superconductors (HTSC). The objective of this work is to search for
    spontaneous magnetic fields generated by a possible time-reversal symmetry
    breaking (TRSB) superconducting state near the surface of hole-doped
    YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-δ</sub> (YBCO), and study the nature of
    the vortex lattice (VL) in YBCO and electron-doped
    Pr<sub>2-x</sub>Ce<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4-δ</sub> (PCCO). For several
    advantages, our measurements were carried out by implanting
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in thin silver films evaporated on the
    superconductors.
    </p>
    <p>
    In our TRSB studies, the magnetic field distribution <i>p</i>(<i>B</i>) is
    measured 8 nm away from the Ag/YBCO interface in magnetic fields
    <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> = 5 to 100 G, applied parallel to the interface.
    <i>p</i>(<i>B</i>) showed significant broadening below the
    <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> of <i>ab</i>- and <i>c</i>-axis oriented YBCO films.
    The broadening signals the existence of weak disordered magnetic fields near
    the surface of YBCO. From the broadening's temperature and field dependence
    we draw an upper limit of 0.2 G on the magnitude of spontaneous magnetic
    fields associated with TRSB.
    </p>
    <p>
    To study the VL, <i>p</i>(<i>B</i>) is measured at average implantation
    depths ranging from 20 to 90 nm away from the Ag/YBCO or Ag/PCCO interface
    in <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> = 0.1 to 33 kG, applied perpendicular to the surface.
    <i>p</i>(<i>B</i>) showed a dramatic broadening below <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>
    as expected from the emerging field lines of the VL in the superconductor.
    In YBCO, <i>p</i>(<i>B</i>) is symmetric and the dependence on
    <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> is much weaker than expected from an ideal VL,
    indicating that the vortex density varies across the face of the sample on a
    long length scale, likely due to vortex pinning at twin boundaries. In PCCO,
    a 2D VL is established due to the high anisotropy of the superconductor
    leading to a nearly symmetric <i>p</i>(<i>B</i>).

    Using low-energy <sup>8</sup>Li beta-detected NMR to probe the magnetism of
    transition metals
  author:
    - T. J. Parolin
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    Low-energy, beta-radiation-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) is
    applied to probe the magnetism of Au and Pd. The measurements were carried
    out at the TRIUMF β-NMR facility using optically spin-polarized
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> as the probe.
    </p>
    <p>
    The behaviour of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in Au was investigated using
    samples in the form of a foil and a 100 nm film evaporated onto a MgO (100)
    substrate. The results are in overall agreement with those obtained
    previously in Ag, Cu, and Al. Narrow, temperature-independent resonances are
    observed and assigned to ions stopping in the octahedral interstitial and
    substitutional lattice sites; the latter appearing only for temperatures
    above 150 K which is attributed to a thermally-activated site change. The
    spin-lattice relaxation rate of substitutional site ions is less than half
    as fast at ambient temperature as that in the other simple metals. The rate
    is independent of external field for fields greater than 15 mT. A Korringa
    analysis for the substitutional ions indicates no significant electron
    enhancement over that of a free electron gas. For all four metals, the
    enhancements obtained are smaller than those for the host nuclei. No depth
    dependence was found for the resonances in Au.
    </p>
    <p>
    The highly exchange-enhanced metal Pd was studied using samples in the form
    of a foil and a 100 nm film evaporated onto a SrTiO<sub>3</sub> (100)
    substrate. Strongly temperature-dependent, negative shifts are observed
    that scale with the temperature dependence of the host susceptibility
    between room temperature and 110 K. The resonances appear as two partially
    resolved lines that exhibit similar behaviour with temperature. The
    linewidths are broad and double upon cooling. The data are indicative of
    ions stopping in a site of cubic symmetry. The spin-lattice relaxation rate
    increases linearly with increasing temperature and eventually saturates at
    higher temperatures, consistent with the prediction from spin fluctuation
    theory. In contrast to the simple metals, large Korringa enhancements are
    obtained in this host. Ferromagnetic dynamical scaling is observed to hold
    above 110 K. Features below this temperature indicate that the Li ions
    locally induce a further enhancement of the static susceptibility. The
    temperature dependence of the modified susceptibility is in keeping with
    the prediction for a weak itinerant ferromagnet just above the Curie
    temperature; however, there is no evidence of static order.

- title: β-Detected NMR of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in spintronic materials
  author:
    - Q. Song
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    β-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (βNMR) employs radioactive
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>, which is optically spin-polarized, as a local
    probe to study magnetism in materials via β decay. In this thesis, βNMR is
    applied to spintronic materials, including GaAs,
    Ga<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>As and Fe/GaAs heterostructures in a
    depth-controlled manner at TRIUMF.
    </p>
    <p>
    High resolution β-NMR measurements were carried out on GaAs crystals
    (semi-insulating (SI-GaAs) and heavily doped <i>n</i>-type (<i>n</i>-GaAs))
    as a control experiment for β-NMR on Fe/GaAs heterostructures. A small
    resonance shift was observed and found to be dependent on depth, temperature
    and doping. The depth dependence is only observed in SI-GaAs and not in
    <i>n</i>-GaAs. The resonance shift below 150 K in both GaAs is ~100 ppm, on
    the same order of some Knight shifts of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in noble
    metals.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ga<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>As is the first βNMR study on a ferromagnetic
    material through the ferromagnetic transition. Both spin lattice relaxation
    (SLR) and resonance of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> were measured. Two
    resonances were clearly resolved from the nonmagnetic GaAs substrate and the
    magnetic Ga<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>As film. The latter one negatively
    shifts and is linearly proportional to the applied field. The hyperfine
    coupling constant <i>A</i><sub>HF</sub> of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in
    Ga<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>As is found to be negative. The SLR rate λ
    does not follow Korringa’s Law and its amplitude shows a weak temperature
    dependence through <i>T<sub>C</sub></i>. The behaviours of <i>A</i><sub>HF</sub> and λ suggest
    that the delocalized holes originate from a Mn derived impurity band. No
    evidence of magnetic phase separation is found.
    </p>
    <p>
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> provides a new depth-dependent local probe to
    detect injected spin polarization. We measured the
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> resonance in Fe/GaAs heterostructures with
    semi-insulating and heavily doped <i>n</i>-type substrates, with and without
    injected current. With zero current, no spin polarization at thermal
    equilibrium is found. A new current injection system was designed and setup
    to conduct current injection from the thin Fe layer into the <i>n</i>-GaAs
    substrate. We found effects of local Joule heating and a very small stray
    field caused by the injected current but no convincing evidence of injected
    spin polarization.

    Synthesis and electronic ordering phenomena of calcium ruthenate thin films
  author:
    - C. J. Dietl
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    The prospect to harness the wide range of electronic phenomena foundin
    transition metal oxides by synthesizing thin film structures and their
    implementation into next-generation technologies has sparked a research
    activity of ever increasing pace. Most prominent are thin film techniques
    such as heterostructuring and strain engineering, whichhave been shown to
    open up new paths to study the rich physics in these compounds.
    </p>
    <p>
    This work constitutes a study of the thin film synthesis of the layered
    orthorhombic transition metal oxide compound Ca<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>
    (CRO) and of the impact of biaxial epitaxial strain on the magnetic and
    orbital ordering phenomena previously found by spectroscopic methods. The
    electronic structure of CRO and other transition metal oxides with
    4<i>d</i>-valence electrons is of significant topical interest, because the
    energy scales of spin-orbit-coupling, exchange energy and crystal field are
    comparable. As a result, the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator CRO plays host
    to an array of novel ground states and is highly susceptible to external
    perturbations as has been shown by numerous studies on single crystals
    involving e.g pressure, chemical substitutionand electrical current.
    </p>
    <p>
    Embarking on the strategy to exploit this sensitivity of CRO, we employ
    strain engineering via thin film growth to tune its properties. The details
    of the synthesis route using pulsed laser deposition arepresented. Growth
    was accomplished with two distinct sets of high-quality samples -
    <i>a</i>-axis oriented films on LaSrAlO<sub>4</sub> and
    NdCaAlO<sub>4</sub> substrates with (110) cut and <i>c</i>-axis oriented
    films on LaAlO<sub>3</sub>, LaSrAlO<sub>4</sub> and YAlO<sub>3</sub>
    substrates with (001) cut. Structural characterization shows that the
    epitaxy exerts strains of 1%–3% on the lattice constants of CRO compared to
    the bulk system. These large distortions manifest themselves in the
    electrical transport properties, which shows that the electronic state can
    be profoundly tuned froman insulator to a metal.
    </p>
    <p>
    Comprehensive resonant elastic X-ray scattering and magnetometry studies
    confirm the presence of antiferromagnetism in CRO on LaAlO<sub>3</sub>,
    NdCaAlO<sub>4</sub> and LaSrAlO<sub>4</sub> (110) at <i>T<sub>N</sub></i> =
    150 K, similar to the antiferromagnetic state found in bulk. Detailed
    polarization analysis of resonant peaks reveals a <i>b</i>-axis oriented
    magnetic moment for CRO on LaSrAlO<sub>4</sub> (110), as found in bulk. On
    the other side, CRO on NdCaAlO<sub>4</sub> shows an unusual signal that is
    compatible with a magnetic moment 45<sup>◦</sup> away from the
    <i>c</i>-axis, approximately along the
    (<span style="text-decoration: overline">1</span>02) direction of the
    orthorhombic unit cell of CRO, which has not been reported for the bulk
    system. Furthermore, magnetoresistance and magnetometry measurements show a
    weak ferromagnetic signal along the <i>c</i>-axis within the
    antiferromagnetic phases. We show that, while a moment direction along the
    <i>b</i>-axis is compatible with a representation analysis of the bulk Pbca
    space group, the presence of a weak ferromagnetic component along the
    <i>c</i>-axis and the peculiar magnetic moment direction along the
    (<span style="text-decoration: overline">1</span>02) for CRO on
    NdCaAlO<sub>4</sub> cannot be described by a single irreducible
    representation of the space group Pbca. Thus, we suggest either an exotic
    scenario with more than one critical irreducible representation or that the
    thin films exhibit anunusual symmetry reduction from the bulk space group
    Pbca. The finding of a strain-induced moment direction switching points to a
    non-trivial effect of epitaxial strain on the magnetic interactions inCRO.
    </p>
    <p>
    Magnetometry, magnetoresistance and polarized neutron reflectometry
    experiments were conducted to investigate a low-temperature ferromagnetic
    phase in the <i>c</i>-axis oriented samples. Similar to pressurized bulk, we
    find ferromagnetic moment amplitudes of the order 0.1 μ<sub>B</sub>/Ru and
    an enhancement under compressive strain. Polarized neutron reflectometry was
    used to exclude impurity phases or surface effects as the underlying
    mechanism. Analogous to the pressurized bulk system, we found a giant
    positive magnetoresistance in CRO on LaAlO<sub>3</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Moreover, a combined nuclear magnetic resonance and resonant elastic X-ray
    scattering study was dedicated to study the impact ofepitaxial strain on
    quadrupolar order previously found in bulk CRO. Due to the small mass of the
    thin films, the nuclear magnetic resonance experiments were conducted using
    the βNMR-technique, which detects the spin lattice relaxation through the
    asymmetry of the β-decay of highly-polarized <sup>8</sup>Li-isotopes. The
    temperature dependenceof the relaxation rate of the <i>c</i>-axis oriented
    films showed an increase towards higher temperatures, starting at ~200 K.
    More detailed measurements on metallic CRO on LaSrAlO<sub>4</sub> (001)
    revealed an anomaly at 300 K, which is reminiscent of a phase transition.
    Since resonant X-ray scattering on bulk CRO showed orbital ordering
    phenomena in the same temperature range, we similarly searched for
    quadrupolar ordering using synchrotron radiation tuned to the Ru-L
    absorption edges. However, the resonant peaks detected in our experiments
    could be fully described by Templeton scattering, a phenomenon arising from
    purely structural effects. For reference purposes, we performed a similar
    analysis for the single crystal showing that the results previously
    interpreted as antiferro-orbital order bear many signatures of Templeton
    scattering as well. Thus, this work motivates a reevaluation of the original
    scattering study. An alternative scenario for the βNMR anomaly based on
    diffusion of the <sup>8</sup>Li-ions is discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
    The synthesis of CRO on a variety of substrates enables furtherstudies of
    the influence of large structural distortions on the electronic states in
    CRO, which are currently inaccessible by pressuretechniques for single
    crystals. This opens up new opportunities to test theories regarding the
    electronic states in CRO, which are intensively debated due to multiple
    competing energy scales. Specifically, arecently proposed strong spin-orbit
    coupling picture for CRO predictsa high sensitivity towards the crystal
    field splitting in this material, which is directly tuned via the epitaxial
    strain. The large tunabilityof the electronic properties CRO by epitaxial
    strain might be usefulfor future thin film devices

    Diffusion and surface trapping of <sup>8</sup>Li in rutile TiO<sub>2</sub>
    and the comparison on <sup>8</sup>Li and <sup>9</sup>Li spin relaxation
    using β-NMR
  author:
    - C. A. Chatzichristos
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    It is well established that the properties of many materials change as their
    thickness is shrunk to the nanoscale, often yielding novel features at the
    near-surface region that are absent in the bulk. Even though there are
    several techniques that can study either the bulk or the surface of these
    materials, there are very few that can scan the near-surface region of
    crystals and thin films versus depth. Beta-detected NMR (β-NMR) is capable
    of this and therefore has been established as a powerful tool for material
    science. This thesis aims to further develop the capabilities of β-NMR.
    </p>
    <p>
    The first part of this thesis demonstrates that by comparing the
    spin-lattice relaxation rates (SLR) of two radioactive Li isotopes
    (<sup>8,9</sup>Li) it is possible to distinguish whether the source of SLR
    in a given situation is driven by magnetic or electric interactions. This is
    an important development for β-NMR, since there are instances where it is
    problematic to distinguish whether the measured relaxation is due to
    magnetic or electric fluctuations. Using this method, it was found that the
    SLR in Pt is (almost) purely magnetic in origin, whereas the spin relaxation
    in SrTiO<sub>3</sub> is driven (almost) entirely by electric quadrupolar
    interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
    The second part of this thesis traces the development of α-radiotracer, that
    uses the progeny α-particles from the decay of <sup>8</sup>Li, in order to
    directly measure the nanoscale diffusivity of Li<sup>+</sup> in Li-ion
    battery materials. To develop this technique, Monte Carlo simulations of the
    experimental configuration were carried out, a new apparatus and a new
    α-detector were designed and used for experiments on rutile TiO<sub>2</sub>.
    In rutile, the measurements revealed that Li<sup>+</sup> gets trapped at the
    (001) surface, a result that helps explain the suppressed intercalation of
    Li<sup>+</sup> in bulk rutile. Moreover, the diffusion rate of
    Li<sup>+</sup> in rutile was found to follow a bi-Arrhenius relationship,
    with a high-<i>T</i> activation energy in agreement with other reported
    measurements and a low-<i>T</i> component of similar magnitude with the
    theoretically calculated diffusion barrier as well as the activation energy
    of the Li-polaron complex found with β-NMR below 100 K.

    Microscopic dynamics of isolated lithium in crystalline solids revealed by
    nuclear magnetic relaxation and resonance of <sup>8</sup>Li
  author:
    - R. M. L. McFadden
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    This thesis reports measurements on the dynamics of isolated lithium in
    single crystal materials using ion-implanted <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected
    nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation and resonance
    measurements, we identify the kinetic parameters describing the ion’s
    site-to-site hop rate – the elementary process in long-range solid-state
    diffusion – and compare the results with theoretical work in the literature,
    as well as experiments at higher concentration. In addition to these "ionic"
    details, the nuclear magnetic resonance probe provides information on the
    electronic properties of the host, whose most intriguing features are also
    discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the one-dimensional ion conductor rutile
    TiO<sub>2</sub>, we find two sets of thermally activated dynamics: one below
    100 K and another at higher temperatures. We suggest the low temperature
    process is unrelated to lithium motion, but rather a consequence of electron
    polarons in the vicinity of the implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>. Above
    100 K, Li<sup>+</sup> undergoes diffusion as an isolated uncomplexed cation,
    characterized by an activation energy and prefactor that are in agreement
    with macroscopic diffusion measurements, but not with theory.
    </p>
    <p>
    In Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>Se, a topological insulator with layered
    tetradymite structure, implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> undergoes ionic
    diffusion above 150 K, likely in the van der Waals gap between adjacent Te
    planes. A comparison with structurally related materials reveals the
    mobility of isolated Li<sup>+</sup> is exceptional. At lower temperature, we
    find linear Korringa-like relaxation, but with a field dependent slope and
    intercept, accompanied by an anomalous field dependence to the resonance
    shift. We suggest that these may be related to a strong contribution from
    orbital currents or the magnetic freezeout of charge carriers in this
    heavily compensated semiconductor.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the doped tetradymite topological insulators
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>:Ca and Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>:Mn, the
    onset of lithium dynamics is suppressed to above 200 K. At low temperatures,
    the nuclear magnetic resonance properties are those of a heavily doped

    The interfacial dynamics of amorphous materials as revealed by β-NMR
    measurements and molecular simulations
  author:
    - D. J. Fujimoto

    <p>
    The free surface is important for developing a fundamental understanding
    of dynamical length scales in glasses. We first investigate the relaxation
    of freestanding atactic polystyrene (aPS) thin films with molecular dynamics
    simulations. As in previous coarse-grained simulations, the surface
    modification on the relaxation times for backbone segments and phenyl rings
    may be expressed as a power law relation, wherein the bulk dynamics fully
    encapsulate the temperature-dependence. Variation of the coupling exponent
    with distance from the surface is consistent with depth-dependent activation
    barriers. We also quantify a reduction of dynamical heterogeneity, transient
    spatial fluctuations of the dynamics, at the interface which can be
    interpreted in the framework of cooperative models for glassy dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
    Capable of depth-resolved measurements near the surface, implanted-ion
    beta-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) has been a powerful
    technique for the study of dynamics in aPS thin films. We have completed and
    commissioned an upgrade to the β-NMR spectrometer, extending the accessible
    upper temperature, and enabling a direct comparison between this
    experimental technique and the molecular dynamics simulations. We
    demonstrate that the modified spectrometer is now capable of operation to at
    least 400 K, an improvement of more than 80 K.
    </p>
    <p>
    We also demonstrate
    the application of β-NMR as a probe of ionic liquid molecular dynamics
    through the measurement of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> spin-lattice
    relaxation (SLR) and resonance in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. The
    motional narrowing of the resonance, and the local maxima in the SLR rate,
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, imply a sensitivity to sub-nanosecond Li<sup>+</sup>
    solvation dynamics. From an analysis of 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, we extract
    an activation energy and Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann constant in agreement with
    the dynamic viscosity of the bulk solvent. Near the melting point, the
    lineshape is broad and intense, and the form of the relaxation is
    non-exponential, reflective of our sensitivity to heterogeneous dynamics
    near the glass transition. We also employ the depth resolution capabilities
    of this technique to probe the subsurface dynamics with nanometer
    resolution. We show modified dynamics near the surface in, and above, the
    glassy state.

    Finite size effects in strongly correlated transition metal oxides probed by
    β-detected NMR
  author:
    - V. L. Karner
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    In this thesis, the strongly correlated metal LaNiO<sub>3</sub> was
    studied in bulk and heterostructures using <sup>8</sup>Li β-NMR. The main
    objective of the thesis was to probe the metallic state and how it changes
    on approach to a dimensionality-induced metal-insulator transition (MIT) in
    heterostructures. With its sensitivity to the metallic state, akin to
    conventional NMR, and ability to study thin films and heterostructures,
    <sup>8</sup>Li β-NMR is uniquely suited to tackle this challenging subject.
    </p>
    <p>
    In bulk LaNiO<sub>3</sub>, spin-lattice relaxation (SLR)
    measurements reveal two equally abundant components with linear temperature
    dependence below 200 K. The linearity is consistent with a Korringa
    mechanism and is evidence of a conventional metallic state. The resonance is
    characterized by a single broad line with a small temperature independent
    Knight shift. The normalized Korringa product indicates substantial
    antiferromagnetic correlations.
    </p>
    <p>
    In LaNiO<sub>3</sub>
    heterostructures with insulating LaAlO<sub>3</sub>, an MIT and Néel order
    has been observed when the thickness of LaNiO<sub>3</sub> is reduced to 2
    u.c.. We used <sup>8</sup>Li β-NMR to study heterostructures with varying
    thicknesses of LaNiO<sub>3</sub>. SLR measurements show two equally abundant
    components with distinct temperature dependences. One component is linear
    with temperature, and only weakly affected by LaNiO<sub>3</sub> thickness.
    In contrast, the second component is non-linear, and strongly depends on
    thickness. We attribute the two component relaxation in the heterostructures
    and bulk LaNiO<sub>3</sub> to microscopic phase separation of the electronic
    state.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, we studied some novel LaNiO<sub>3</sub>
    heterostructures where LaAlO<sub>3</sub> was replaced with the magnetic
    insulator La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>. Bulk La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>
    is characterized by long-range antiferromagnetic order below
    <i>T<sub>N</sub></i> ≈ 300 K which is extremely sensitive to doping. In a
    La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> film, SLR measurements reveal fast but
    measurable 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>. We see evidence of magnetic order not
    from a peak in 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> but instead by a gradual loss of
    asymmetry beginning at 140 K. We attribute the suppression of
    <i>T<sub>N</sub></i> and the broad transition to inhomogeneous hole doping
    in the film. Below 40 K, an upturn in 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> suggests
    freezing of mobile holes from the more doped regions of the sample. The
    behavior in the heterostructures is similar to the
    La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> film.

    Ion-implanted <sup>8</sup>Li nuclear magnetic resonance study of van der
    Waals layered materials
  author:
    - J. Ticknor
  abstract: >-
    This thesis explores the behavior of dilute-limit lithium in different van
    der Waals layered materials. The rationale for this choice is that their
    spacious, two-dimensional atomic structure enables their use as good
    electrode hosts in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. In order to assist
    efforts to simulate the mobility (or diffusion) of the lithium from
    first-principles, we make use of <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected nuclear magnetic
    resonance. Here, an isotopically pure beam of <sup>8</sup>Li is implanted
    directly into a suitable sample. The <sup>8</sup>Li are isolated
    (non-interacting) from one another, a situation that is ideally comparable
    to theory, in contrast to the more concentrated regime that is dealt with in
    most other experimental studies of diffusion. By monitoring the asymmetric
    β-decay of the <sup>8</sup>Li correlated to its spin polarization, we are
    sensitive to the temporal evolution of the local magnetic and electric field
    distribution in the vicinity of the <sup>8</sup>Li probe as it moves within
    its crystalline environment. Measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation
    rate, as well as the resonance linewidth, are then connected to a model of
    the elementary atomic hopping of the lithium. We apply this in three
    separate case studies: semimetallic graphite, semiconducting MoX<sub>2</sub>
    (X = S, Se), and metallic CrSe<sub>2</sub>. We find an absence of diffusive
    mobility of lithium in graphite even to 400 K, marking a clear departure
    from the more concentrated stage compounds. However, we find quantitative
    evidence of lithium diffusion in both MoX<sub>2</sub> and CrSe<sub>2</sub>
    near room temperature. The respective activation energy barriers in each
    case are closely compared to prior results from theory. Other phenomena
    (e.g., magnetic effects) that act in parallel to diffusion are also closely
    examined.

    Depth-resolved studies of SRF materials using high parallel-field beta-NMR
    spectrometer
  author:
    - E. Thoeng
  abstract: >-
    <p>
    This thesis reports the implementation of a new spectrometer, which extends
    the capability of TRIUMF β-NMR facility with fields up to 200 mT parallel
    to the sample surface. The spectrometer is designed to allow nm-scale
    depth-resolved studies of superconducting RF (SRF) materials up to the
    critical field of Nb, the main material for SRF cavities. SRF cavities are
    the main technology behind high-energy and high-power linear accelerators
    worldwide. The accelerating electric fields along the cavity axis are
    accompanied by the radio frequency (RF) magnetic fields parallel to the
    cavity wall, which induce dissipation due to the penetrating magnetic fields
    within ~100 nm of the cavity surface.
    </p>
    <p>
    The ability of the SRF materials to screen magnetic fields and the maximum
    field limit are very sensitive to surface treatments. The magnetic
    field-dependent surface dissipation affects the operational cost of SRF
    cavities, and the maximum magnetic field that can be sustained ultimately
    limits the maximum accelerating gradient. Various surface treatment recipes
    using heat treatment and/or impurity diffusion have been developed which
    demonstrate enhanced performance of SRF cavities. Complete understanding of
    the underlying mechanism of this enhancement, however, requires a controlled
    study of the near surface. Depth-resolved measurements of the magnetic field
    screening below the surface are made possible with this new spectrometer,
    which combines local magnetic field measurements via spin-polarized
    radioactive ion beam produced at TRIUMF, and the spectrometer which allows
    high-parallel field and implantation depth-control of the ions.
    </p>
    <p>
    The magnetic field configuration parallel to the sample surface but
    transverse to the beam momentum deflects the beam vertically and requires
    compensation via electrostatic steering. The details of design, assembly,
    installation, and operations of the beamline and the spectrometer are all
    presented in this thesis. Depth-resolved measurements on two Nb samples with
    different surface treatments relevant to SRF cavities have been performed on
    the new spectrometer up to 200 mT. The results demonstrate the sensitivity
    of the β-NMR technique in characterizing the magnetic field screening and
    provide a working method for future studies. Outlook on future experiments
    on different SRF materials, as well as potential applications of the new
    spectrometer for other materials are proposed.
